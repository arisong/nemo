"ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) — An international team has launched its helium-filled balloon from Japan in a bid to reach North America and break two major records en route. 
 
 Pilots Troy Bradley of New Mexico and Leonid Tiukhtyaev of Russia set off from Saga, Japan, shortly before 6:30 a.m. Sunday Japan time. 
 
 ""Everything went just like a textbook,"" said Letitia Hill, social media director for the team's mission control in Albuquerque. 
 
 Unfavorable weather changes scuttled two previous launch attempts more than a week ago. 
 
 The pilots are looking to reach North America, an attempt that will put them on course to break a distance record of 5,208 miles. They also want to break the flight-duration record set in 1978 when Ben Abruzzo, Maxie Anderson and Larry Newman made the first trans-Atlantic balloon flight. That record of 137 hours in the air in a traditional gas balloon is considered the holy grail of ballooning achievements. 
 
 The team is expected to land in the next 5 ½ days, Hill said. But where they will land is anyone's guess. 
 
 ""That's going to keep us on the edge of our seats for this mission,"" Hill said after watching the launch at the Anderson-Abruzzo Albuquerque International Balloon Museum. 
 
 Bradley and Tiukhtyaev's balloon — dubbed Two Eagles — is outfitted with a high-tech navigation system, basic necessities such as a first-aid kit, and equipment to communicate with the command center. 
 
 It will fly at an altitude of at least 15,000 feet. The pilots will have oxygen masks and will be bundled up. The temperature inside their capsule will be about 50 degrees. 
 
 The pilots have to be physically fit to endure several days inside the capsule, with little sleep and limited oxygen. In addition to the record attempts, the flight is being monitored by researchers at Arizona State University who are studying the effects of fatigue on cognitive ability. 
 
 It's possible the pilots could be aloft for 10 days, which is the outer limit of the balloon's capabilities, the team said. 
 
 Once the hatch is closed and the pilots are inside, it's much like a video game, monitoring the GPS and other systems for updates on weather conditions, speed and altitude, Bradley told The Associated Press in October. ||||| .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... 
 
 ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — After experiencing delays earlier this month, an international team aiming to break two major ballooning records finally launched a helium-filled balloon Sunday. 
 
 Pilots Troy Bradley, 50, of Albuquerque, and Russian Leonid Tiukhtyaev, 58, set off from Saga, Japan, shortly before 6:30 a.m. local time (just before 2:30 p.m. Saturday in Albuquerque). 
 
 “Everything went just like a textbook,” said Letitia Hill, social media director for the team’s Mission Control in Albuquerque. 
 
 Unfavorable weather changes scuttled two previous launch attempts more than a week ago. 
 
 The pilots are looking to reach North America, an attempt that will put them on course to break a distance record of 5,208 miles. 
 
 The record was set by Albuquerqueans Ben Abruzzo, Larry Newman and Ron Clark, and Japanese-born American restaurateur Rocky Aoki, who launched from Nagashima, Japan, in November 1981 and landed in California’s Mendocino National Forest. 
 
 They also want to break the flight-duration record set in 1978 when Abruzzo, Newman and Maxie Anderson made the first trans-Atlantic balloon flight. That record of 137 hours in the air in a traditional gas balloon is considered the Holy Grail of ballooning achievements. 
 
 The team is expected to reach the West Coast in 5 ½ days, and they can continue inland for a couple days after. 
 
 But where they will land is anyone’s guess. 
 
 “That’s going to keep us on the edge of our seats for this mission,” Hill said after watching the launch at the Anderson-Abruzzo Albuquerque International Balloon Museum. 
 
 Mission Control is a small room in the Balloon Museum. The control room will be staffed day and night until the balloon lands. 
 
 The team, which includes balloonists, a meteorologist, a physician and a search-and-rescue expert, uses satellite phones to talk to the pilots, and there are also several different types of radios inside the aircraft. 
 
 “On any flight of this nature,” Bradley said at a news conference in October, “there is always the possibility of things going wrong. We have to have a team tracking us.” 
 
 Bradley and Tiukhtyaev’s balloon – dubbed Two Eagles – is outfitted with a high-tech navigation system, basic necessities such as a first-aid kit, and communications equipment. It is 140 tall, 90 feet wide and filled with 350,000 cubic feet of gas. 
 
 It will fly at an altitude of at least 15,000 feet. The pilots will have oxygen masks and will be bundled up. The temperature inside their capsule will be about 50 degrees. 
 
 The balloon was flying over Japan at 19,000 feet Saturday evening. In just under four hours, the balloon had traveled about 120 miles, according to the team’s website. 
 
 The pilots have to be physically fit to endure several days inside the capsule, with little sleep and limited oxygen. In addition to the record attempts, the flight is being monitored by researchers at Arizona State University who are studying the effects of fatigue on cognitive ability. 
 
 Track the balloon 
 
 The Two Eagles website, The Two Eagles website, twoeaglesballoonteam.com , includes live tracking of the balloon’s position and regular updates from Mission Control. 
 
 It’s possible the pilots could be aloft for 10 days, which is the outer limit of the balloon’s capabilities, the team said. 
 
 Once the hatch is closed and the pilots are inside, it’s much like a video game, monitoring the GPS and other systems for updates on weather conditions, speed and altitude, Bradley told The Associated Press in October. 
 
 Bradley and his wife, Tami, live in Albuquerque and have two children. Bradley regularly flies hot-air balloons in the Duke City and owns and operates a hot-air balloon company. He has set records before in gas, hot-air and gas and hot-air combination Roziére balloons.","– Riding in a 140-foot tall balloon filled with 350,000 cubic feet of gas, an American and a Russian have set off from Japan in the hopes of setting two balloon ride records at once. First, Troy Bradley, 50, and Leonid Tiukhtyaev, 58, hope to reach North America and break the current distance record of 5,208 miles, which was set between Japan and the US in 1981. And second, they hope to reach the West Coast in 5.5 days and then head inland another day or two, breaking the duration record of 137 hours (5.7 days) set in 1978, reports the AP. ""Everything went just like a textbook,"" said team social media director Letitia Hill just after takeoff early yesterday. (Bad weather delayed two previous attempts earlier this month.) Mission Control, situated in a small room at a balloon museum in Albuquerque, includes balloonists, a meteorologist, a physician, and a search-and-rescue expert, who are staying in touch with the pilots via satellite phones, reports the Albuquerque Journal. The balloon, called Two Eagles, is equipped with several types of radios, a high-tech navigation system, and basics like food and a first-aid kit. The men will wear oxygen masks and stay bundled up in the 50-degree cabin as they fly at an expected altitude of at least 15,000 feet. It's possible the pilots could be in flight for as many as 10 days, the balloon's apparent outer limits, and it's not clear where they'll come down. ""That’s going to keep us on the edge of our seats for this mission,"" says Hill. Bradley and Tiukhtyaev are also being monitored by Arizona State University researchers studying fatigue's effects on cognition.

"The kudzu bug has arrived from Asia, and it's spreading rapidly throughout the southeastern United States. Considering that the bug usually eats kudzu, an invasive plant that has displaced many native species and wreaked environmental havoc, one might be tempted to think that this isn't such a bad thing. 
 
 But there's just one problem: The kudzu bug is also rather fond of eating soybeans, and new research shows it can complete an entire life cycle on soybean plants, devastating whole fields of the legume. It also has no known natural predators in the United States. 
 
 Given the bugs' ravenous appetite and ever-expanding range, the insect is poised to create real trouble for soybean farmers nationwide, and perhaps even in other countries, said Dominic Reisig, a researcher at North Carolina State University. 
 
 The bug, native to Japan and East Asia, was first found in the United States in 2009 in Atlanta, Georgia, Reisig said. By 2010, it was only found in one county in North Carolina, two states to the north. By 2011, it was found in half of the state's counties. Last year, it was found in every county sampled. 
 
 It can now be found as far west as Mississippi and Tennessee and north to Virginia. From 2011 to 2012, the estimated cost of treating the insect in North Carolina alone increased more than tenfold, to $840,000, Reisig said. It's likely to cost more than ten times that much to treat it this year, he said. 
 
 The kudzu bug has a unique lifestyle. The first generation hatches in the spring. Then these bugs lay eggs and give rise to a second generation in the summer. These second-generation insects mature in a couple months and lay eggs that hatch in the spring. 
 
 The kudzu bug was previously thought to have just chomped away at the kudzu plant. Then some first-generation adults were found transferring to soybeans and laying eggs that grew up eating the crop. And Reisig's research has found that these pernicious bugs can survive on soybeans during all phases of their lives. His latest study was published recently in Journal of Economic Entomology. 
 
 One experiment in Georgia illustrates the impact of the bugs. The experiment looked at two fields, both infested with kudzu bugs; one field was sprayed with insecticide, while the other was left alone. The untreated field lost 70 percent of its yield compared to the treated one, Reisig said. He estimates that infestations may reduce soybeans yields by about 15 percent on average. 
 
 The good news is that the bugs are relatively easy to treat, with one application of common insecticides. But this isn't ideal, since you never want to have to spray more pesticides, Reisig said. There is currently work being done to see if a parasitic wasp—which lays eggs inside the bug's body—can be imported from Japan. But the research is still underway, and getting the necessary approval to introduce an exotic species can take years. 
 
 Meanwhile, the bug is spreading quickly, thanks to its strong flying ability. Reisig said the bugs could possibly live just about anywhere that soybeans grow, though it doesn't tolerate cold weather early in the season very well. 
 
 The insect is also a capable hitchhiker. The insects are found on tall, white objects—Reisig, as an extension specialist, often gets calls from homeowners annoyed to find a huge group of the bugs on the exterior of their white houses. Considering the bug was first found near an airfield in Atlanta, Reisig guesses that the bugs may have hitched a ride on an airplane. They are likely spreading via automobiles as well. One recent discovery of the bugs, in Mississippi, took place a long distance from the nearest known infestation. 
 
 ""It looked like it jumped the whole state,"" Reisig said. ""That was on a kudzu patch by the interstate."" 
 
 The area's soybean farmers better be on the lookout. ||||| Research finds invasive kudzu bugs may pose greater threat than previously thought

 The invasive kudzu bug has the potential to be a major agricultural pest, causing significant damage to economically important soybean crops. Conventional wisdom has held that the insect pests will be limited to areas in the southern United States, but new research from North Carolina State University shows that they may be able to expand into other parts of the country. 
 
 Kudzu bugs (Megacopta cribraria) are native to Asia, and were first detected in the U.S. in Georgia in 2009. They have since expanded their territory as far north as Virginia. The bugs have an interesting life cycle, which has been thought to be a limiting factor on far they can spread. 
 
 Eggs laid in the spring hatch into a first generation, which we'll call ""Generation A."" The immature bugs of Generation A normally feed on kudzu plants until they reach adulthood, when they have been known to move into commercial soybean fields. These mature adults lay eggs that hatch into Generation B during the summer months. Generation B kudzu bugs can feed on soybean crops during both their immature and adult life stages, causing significant crop damage. 
 
 Because the immature Generation A kudzu bugs have only been seen to feed on kudzu, researchers thought that the pest would not be able to migrate to northern and western parts of the United States, where kudzu doesn't grow. But now it's not so clear. 
 
 Under controlled conditions in a greenhouse laboratory, researchers at NC State found that immature Generation A kudzu bugs were not limited to feeding on kudzu – they were able to feed exclusively on soybeans, reach maturity and reproduce. 
 
 ""Researchers began seeing some of this behavior in the wild in 2012 and, while those data aren't quite ready for publication, our lab work and the field observations indicate that kudzu bugs are potentially capable of spreading into any part of the U.S. where soybeans are grown. And soybeans are grown almost everywhere,"" says Dr. Dominic Reisig, an assistant professor of entomology at NC State and co-author of a paper on the research. ""It also means that both annual generations of kudzu bugs could attack soybean crops in areas where the bug is already established, which would double the impact on farmers.""

 The paper, ""First-Generation Megacopta cribraria (Hemiptera: Plataspidae) Can Develop on Soybeans,"" is a ""rapid communication"" article in the April issue of the Journal of Economic Entomology. Lead author of the paper is NC State doctoral student Alejandro Del Pozo-Valdivia. The research was supported by the United Soybean Board and the North Carolina Soybean Producers Association. 
 
 North Carolina State University: http://www.ncsu.edu","– Kudzu plants have been choking the Southeast for years, so at first blush it would seem that the 2009 arrival of the kudzu-eating kudzu bug from Asia would be a blessing. No so much. It turns out the bugs favor a second crop as well: soybeans. And on the heels of new research, scientists fear the bugs could do serious damage to soybean farms far beyond the Southeast, reports Lab Spaces. It explains how the quirks of the bugs' life cycle are fanning fears: Eggs laid in the spring develop into bugs (Generation A) that eat only kudzu plants while they are young, and can move on to soybean plants only as they mature. These mature bugs lay more threatening eggs that hatch in summer (Generation B) and can feast on soybean crops from the get-go. Given the diet limitations of the immature Generation A bugs, researchers figured they wouldn't be able to migrate to areas without kudzu, the northern and western US. But using a greenhouse lab, North Carolina State University researchers observed immature Generation A bugs eating ... soybeans alone. The new research suggests ""kudzu bugs are potentially capable of spreading into any part of the US where soybeans are grown. And soybeans are grown almost everywhere,"" says study co-author Dr. Dominic Reisig, who notes they bugs are likely spreading by attaching themselves to planes and cars. TakePart reports while the bug has no natural predator here, insecticides are fairly effective in wiping them out—but that obviously means dousing crops in more chemicals. Bringing in a parasitic wasp from Japan could hasten their undoing, but getting the OK to import an exotic species can take years.","['The kudzu bug has arrived from Asia, and it\'s spreading rapidly throughout the southeastern United States.

 The 7-year-old brought his uncle to his mother's car and opened up the trunk, himself. Inside was drug paraphernalia, sitting right next to some of the boy's toys. 
 
 Shocked, Peter closed the trunk, took the boy inside and called 911. 
 
 
 
 ""Her son, who's 7, just told me she keeps bad stuff in her car, and he opened up the trunk, and she has a meth lab in her trunk,"" Peter told a 911 dispatcher. 
 
 
 
 The 911 operator told Peter to get away from the car, because of the volatility of materials used to cook meth. 
 
 When police arrived, they found dozens of items inside the trunk used to cook and use meth. 
 
 What's worse, the boy also described to Peter just how his mom allegedly manufactured meth. 
 
 ""He said when they would get all this stuff together, they would put it all in a soda bottle, and they would shake the soda bottle and take the top off to, I guess, vent it out,"" Peter said. 
 
 
 
 Police charged Buchanan with child neglect, possession of chemicals, meth and paraphernalia, and manufacturing and delivery of meth. 
 
 After Buchanan's arrest, her son was taken in by his grandmother, away from a world Peter says no boy his age should have to see. 
 
 ""I can already tell you, just looking at his face, he is relieved to be out of the situation,"" Peter said. 
 
 
 
 The boy's grandmother planned to enroll him in school this week. 
 
 
 
 Edgewater police said they were investigating to see if Briana Buchanan could be charged with trafficking meth, which has a harsher punishment. ||||| A Volusia County mother was arrested after her 7-year-old son allegedly told their landlord she was making methamphetamine in the trunk of her car, according to Edgewater police. 
 
 Briana Buchanan, 27, was arrested Friday after her son showed their landlord ""mommy's bad stuff in her car,"" according to the arrest report. 
 
 Buchanan's son allegedly told their landlord how the bad stuff is made and said, ""Mommy goes to the store and lies to the people, saying she is sick and needs medicine,"" according to the report. 
 
 The man said Buchanan and her son have been staying with him for a month. 
 
 ""He opened up the car and he pointed to a bag and right away its everything you've seen online related to meth labs,"" the man told WESH 2. ""So I pulled him away and I called 911."" 
 
 Investigators said the department's meth response team came to the home and dismantled the lab in the trunk of Buchanan's car.

"BOSTON — Her free skate was not yet complete, but Gracie Gold, 18, landed a double axel and smiled and pumped her fists. 
 
 It was clear to Gold, and to everyone else at TD Garden on Saturday night, that she had just won her first national figure skating title and would be headed to the Winter Olympics next month in Sochi, Russia. 
 
 Drama continued Sunday when the American women’s team was officially named. In what will be a much-debated decision, Ashley Wagner was chosen over Mirai Nagasu despite a faltering skate on Saturday in which Wagner fell twice and stumbled through a slow and cautious routine that she called embarrassing. 
 
 The other American woman chosen was Polina Edmunds, 15, who finished second on Saturday while skating the most ambitious technical program among the contenders. ||||| BOSTON — At the end of last season, it already seemed clear Gracie Gold had surpassed two-time U.S. champion Ashley Wagner as the leading U.S. women's skater, even if Gold had been one place behind Wagner at both the 2013 national and world championships. 
 
 Now there is no doubt, given Gold's utter dominance of the U.S. Figure Skating Championships that ended Saturday with the 18-year-old from Springfield winning her first national title. Wagner acknowledged that during the awards ceremony when she told Gold, ""Congratulations, you were the star of the night."" 
 
 There also was little doubt Wagner would get one of the three spots on the 2014 U.S. Olympic team, despite a fourth-place finish that included a desultory short program and a dismal free skate, performances she unashamedly called ""embarrassing."" 
 
 Sunday, U.S. Figure Skating picked the top two finishers, Gold and 15-year-old Polina Edmunds, but bumped third-place Mirai Nagasu in favor of Wagner. 
 
 Was there a formal vote? If so, what was the tally? We apparently will never know, as USFS officials were as vague about such procedures as they were in creating selection rules that allowed body of work over the past year to carry a significant but nonspecific amount of weight. 
 
 In Wagner's case, that tipped the balance. 
 
 ""If you look at Ashley Wagner's record and performance, she has the top credentials of any of our female skaters,"" USFS President Patricia St. Peter said. ""We don't use a single competition as the sole measurement for who should participate in the Olympic Winter Games."" 
 
 Wagner, 22, had advocates in Boston to remind everyone of those credentials, which included being the top U.S. finisher (fourth and fifth) at the last two world championships. Nagasu, unavailable for comment, came here with no coach and an erratic record since she took fourth — the top U.S. finish — at the 2010 Olympics. 
 
 Oh, yes, and NBC has made Wagner one of its most heavily promoted athletes in the buildup to next month's Olympics. 
 
 At nationals, the fourth finisher gets a pewter medal. Some alchemy turned it into something as good as gold for Wagner, even if she had been no match for Gracie Gold. 
 
 So the federation put the results aside, a move apparently unprecedented when applied to someone who had competed at the pre-Olympic nationals. It had previously happened in the cases of naming athletes unable to skate in the meet because of injuries: Todd Eldredge in 1992, Nancy Kerrigan in 1994, pairs team Jenni Meno-Todd Sand in 1998 and Michelle Kwan in 2006. 
 
 ""This one horrible performance is not what makes me the skater that I am,"" Wagner said. ""[The federation] is giving me the opportunity to go into the Olympics and make everyone forget about this."" 
 
 What still makes Wagner's selection problematic is that for the second straight year, she has come undone in the free skate at the last two events heading to a global championship, worlds or Olympics. 
 
 In both December's Grand Prix Final and this nationals, Wagner received negative grades of execution on four jumps, with two falls here and one in the final. A year earlier, she fell twice in the free skate at both events. 
 
 ""There seems to be a little bit of a pattern,"" Wagner said, with a laugh. ""Hopefully, I got the worst out of my system. I will admit I didn't pull through at the national championships when I felt pressure. Going into the Olympics, I can just let myself skate without worrying about whether I am going to watch my dreams fall apart."" 
 
 Wagner had missed earning one of the two U.S. women's spots at the 2010 Olympics by finishing third to Rachael Flatt and Nagasu at the U.S. championships. 
 
 Nagasu, 20, of Arcadia, was the only one of the top four to deliver an essentially clean free skate here. That she had finished seventh at the previous two U.S. championships undoubtedly gave the selection committee a reason to bypass her. 
 
 ""Hopefully they pick me to the team,"" Nagasu had said Saturday. ""I haven't always been the most consistent skater, but under pressure I have been the most consistent skater most of the time."" 
 
 Edmunds, the ingenue from San Jose, came to Boston with no expectations. The Olympic Games will be her first senior-level event. 
 
 ""Go big or go home,"" Gold said of Edmunds. 
 
 She has a similar mind-set about herself. In just four months after leaving her training base and former coach in the Chicago suburbs for Frank Carroll in Los Angeles, Gold's words and actions are evidence of having overcome confidence issues that have plagued her for several seasons. 
 
 ""I came here not to just make the team, I came to this national championships to win,"" she said. ""The closer we get to Sochi, the more and more I want to be going for a medal. I think it's a realistic goal."" 
 
 It would also be a historic achievement. No one named Gold ever has won an Olympic medal of any color in any sport. 
 
 phersh@tribune.com","– In an unprecedented snub, US Figure Skating has left the third place finisher at Saturday's US Figure Skating Championships off its Olympic roster—in favor of a fourth-place finisher who described her own performance as ""embarrassing."" Why? Because that fourth-place finisher was Ashley Wagner, winner of the 2012 and 2013 national championships, and, coincidentally enough, one of the athletes NBC has been most heavily promoting ahead of the Sochi games, the New York Times reports. Indeed, Philip Hersh at the LA Times writes that there ""was little doubt"" she'd get the nod yesterday, despite a ""dismal"" free skate. Wagner fell twice in that free skate, and neither her short nor long programs contained a triple-triple combination, the minimum required to medal in Sochi. She was selected over Mirai Nagasu, the only skater with what Hersh calls an ""essentially clean"" free skate, and the only one with Olympic experience. Until now, the US has always taken its top championship finishers, except in cases of injury. But committee rules actually allow it to consider a skater's body of work, and Nagasu finished seventh at the past two championships.

"[WASHINGTON, DC] – Congressman Steve Cohen (TN-09), a member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee’s Subcommittee on Aviation, today introduced a the Seat Egress in Air Travel (SEAT) Act to direct the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to establish minimum seat size standards for the safety and health of airline passengers. 
 
 “Consumers are tired of being squeezed both physically and fiscally by airlines,” said Congressman Cohen. “Shrinking seat sizes isn’t just a matter of comfort but safety and health as well. The Federal Aviation Administration requires that planes be capable of rapid evacuation in case of emergency, yet they haven’t conducted emergency evacuation tests on all of today’s smaller seats. Doctors have also warned that deep vein thrombosis can afflict passengers who can’t move their legs during longer flights.” 
 
 The average distance between rows of seats has dropped from 35 inches before airline deregulation in the 1970s to about 31 inches today. The average width of an airline seat has also shrunk from 18 inches to about 16 ½. ||||| Congressman: It's time to regulate the size of airline seats

 Is it time for Congress to get involved in regulating the size of airline seats? 
 
 That’s what one member of the House of Representatives is proposing. Tennessee Democrat Steve Cohen – who sits on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee’s Subcommittee on Aviation – plans to introduce legislation that would institute minimum seat sizes for passenger airlines.

 Cohen plans to offer his “Seat Egress in Air Travel Act” – or SEAT Act – as an amendment to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Reauthorization bill, which the committee is scheduled to vote on this Thursday. 
 
 Cohen’s move comes as some airlines have introduced new slimmer seat designs during the past decade that have allowed them to squeeze more seats onto planes. The slimmer seats are also lighter, helping carriers save fuel. And beyond the so-called ""slimline' seats, certain carriers -- led in particular by a new breed of ultra low-cost carriers -- have also become more aggressive in reducing leg room as part of their efforts to increase capacity on their aircraft.

 As for Cohen’s SEAT Act, it likely faces long odds about ultimately being passed into law. But Cohen intends to push ahead with the effort. 
 
 “Shrinking seats raise safety and health concerns, and it’s time for the FAA to take action,” Cohen says in a statement. “The FAA requires that planes be capable of rapid evacuation in case of emergency, yet they haven’t conducted emergency evacuation tests on all of today’s smaller seats.”

"Global dietary guidelines should change to suggest people can eat more fat than previously thought, with a view to preventing overconsumption of carbohydrates, according to a new international study led by Canadian researchers. 
 
 ""Our findings do not support the current recommendation to limit total fat intake to less than 30 per cent of energy,"" said the paper published in the Lancet on Tuesday. ""Individuals with high carbohydrate intake might benefit from a reduction in carbohydrate intake and increase in the consumption of fats."" 
 
 Mahshid Dehghan, a nutritional epidemiology expert at McMaster University in Hamilton, and her team were set to present the results of their study at the European Society of Cardiology Congress in Barcelona on Tuesday. (Population Health Research Institute) 
 
 Scientists from McMaster University in Hamilton and other researchers used questionnaires to document the fat, carbohydrate and protein intake of 135,335 people in 18 countries, then followed them over an average of about seven years. 
 
 The research team, led by Mahshid Dehghan, a nutrition epidemiologist at McMaster, was set to present the results of the study at the European Society of Cardiology Congress in Barcelona on Tuesday. 
 
 The researchers looked at whether or not participants of the epidemiological study developed heart disease or stroke. They also documented the number of deaths due to cardiovascular disease as well as other causes, including cancer, and respiratory and infectious diseases. 
 
 Contrary to popular thinking over the last few decades, the researchers found no significant association between eating more than the recommended amount of fat and developing heart disease or having a stroke. In addition, a fat intake of about 35 per cent of total calories was associated with a lower overall risk of dying compared to a lower percentage of fat in the diet. 
 
 In contrast, people who ate a lot of carbohydrates (more than 60 per cent of their total calorie intake) were at higher risk of death overall, as well as death not related to cardiovascular disease. 
 
 ""When you recommend lowering fat, by default, people increase their carbohydrate consumption,"" said Dehghan. ""And increasing consumption of carbohydrates results in higher risk of mortality."" 
 
 Moderation is the solution. Don't eat too much of any single thing. - Richard Bazinet, U of T's Department of Nutritional Sciences 
 
 That's why nutritional guidelines around the world need to change, Dehghan told CBC News. 
 
 ""Relaxing current restrictions on fat and emphasizing on carbohydrate intake ... is more likely to be beneficial."" 
 
 The study did not find that a certain type of fat — saturated or unsaturated — had any significant impact on cardiovascular disease. In fact, both saturated and unsaturated fats were associated with a lower risk of total mortality and stroke. 
 
 However, the authors note that they were unable to specifically measure trans fat consumption — a potentially important limitation in the study. Cardiologists have recognized the specific danger of trans fats, which are artificial and also known as partially hydrogenated oils. Canada is moving toward banning trans fats — something New York City has already done in its restaurants and bakeries. 
 
 There has been mounting scientific evidence over the last five years challenging the long-held notion that fat is to blame for cardiovascular disease and death, said Richard Bazinet, of the Department of Nutritional Sciences at the University of Toronto, who was not involved in the Lancet-published study. 
 
 In the last couple of decades, that notion led to a slew of low-fat and fat-free products on grocery store shelves. 
 
 The problem, Bazinet said, is many of those products contain high levels of sugar and carbohydrates, substituting other sources of calories that pose health risks. 
 
 Richard Bazinet, a scientist with the Department of Nutritional Sciences at the University of Toronto, says the vast scope of the Lancet study adds to mounting evidence that fat is not the main cause of cardiovascular disease. (Keith Burgess/CBC) 
 
 ""We're seeing that play out maybe with people thinking that things like juices are fine and sweetened, you know, foods that say low in fat are a great choice. A cookie's still a cookie even if it doesn't have saturated fat or high fat content."" 
 
 Dehghan, the study's lead author, emphasized that the research looked solely at cardiovascular disease and mortality, and did not look at the effects of fats and carbohydrates on obesity — a health issue of particular concern in North America. 
 
 According to Statistics Canada, more than half of adult Canadians were overweight or obese, based on body mass index (BMI), in 2014. 
 
 Although Bazinet largely agrees with the study's findings, he said the constant onslaught of research focused on specific nutrients like fat or carbohydrates and ""blaming one versus the other"" may be ""missing the mark"" in educating the public on how to make healthy food choices. 
 
 ""Moderation"" is the solution, he said. ""Don't eat too much of any single thing."" ||||| Low-fat diets could raise the risk of early death by almost one quarter, a major study has found. 
 
 The Lancet study of 135,000 adults found those who cut back on fats had far shorter lives than those enjoying plenty of butter, cheese and meats. 
 
 Researchers said the study was at odds with repeated health advice to cut down on fats. 
 
 Those doing so tended to eat far too much stodgy food like bread, pasta and rice, the experts said, while missing out on vital nutrients. 
 
 Participants eating the highest levels of carbohydrates – particularly refined sugars found in fizzy drinks and processed meals – faced a 28 per cent higher risk of early death. 
 
 The NHS cautions against having too much saturated fat, on the grounds it raises cholesterol levels, increasing the risk of heart disease. 
 
 But the latest research, presented at the European Society of Cardiology Congress, in Barcelona found those with low intake of saturated fat raised chances of early death by 13 per cent compared to those eating plenty. 
 
 And consuming high levels of all fats cut mortality by up to 23 per cent. 
 
 The Canadian study tracked eating patterns and death rates across 18 countries.","– Fat, it turns out, is good for you. Or at least it's not as bad as we previously thought, per a sweeping new study that suggests low-fat diets could increase the risk of early death, the Telegraph reports. The surprising findings published in the Lancet suggest that instead of limiting fat intake, we should be counting carbs. Low-fat diets ""put populations at increased risk for cardiovascular disease,"" says Dr. Andrew Mente from Canada's McMaster University. Overturning dietary guidelines the world over, the research of Mente and his team indicates that a higher consumption of fats, even saturated fats like those found in meat and butter, reduces chances of dying earlier. The scientists who tracked 135,000 adults in 18 countries found that those who got more than 60% of their calories from carbohydrates, such as sugary drinks and processed foods like pasta and bread, had a 28% chance of dying early. Those who consumed high levels of fats, even the saturated kind, saw their risk of early death drop by 23%. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the seven-year study found no link between fat consumption alone and heart disease or stroke, CBC News reports. But in a notable limitation, researchers were unable to measure levels of trans fat, often linked to heart disease, in study subjects. Study co-author Dr. Mahshid Dehghan says that when lowering fat consumption, people ""by default"" eat more carbs. He called for ""relaxing current restrictions on fat and emphasizing ... carbohydrate intake."" The ""sweet spot,"" Mente adds, per the Telegraph, is maintaining a balanced diet, with about 35% of calories coming from fat.

They also documented the number of deaths due to cardiovascular disease as well as other causes, including cancer, and respiratory and infectious diseases. \n \n Contrary to popular thinking over the last few decades, the researchers found no significant association between eating more than the recommended amount of fat and developing heart disease or having a stroke. In addition, a fat intake of about 35 per cent of total calories was associated with a lower overall risk of dying compared to a lower percentage of fat in the diet. \n \n In contrast, people who ate a lot of carbohydrates (more than 60 per cent of their total calorie intake) were at higher risk of death overall, as well as death not related to cardiovascular disease. \n \n ""When you recommend lowering fat, by default, people increase their carbohydrate consumption,"" said Dehghan. ""And increasing consumption of carbohydrates results in higher risk of mortality."" \n \n Moderation is the solution. Don\'t eat too much of any single thing. - Richard Bazinet, U of T\'s Department of Nutritional Sciences \n \n That\'s why nutritional guidelines around the world need to change, Dehghan told CBC News. \n \n ""Relaxing current restrictions on fat and emphasizing on carbohydrate intake ... is more likely to be beneficial."" \n \n The study did not find that a certain type of fat — saturated or unsaturated — had any significant impact on cardiovascular disease. In fact, both saturated and unsaturated fats were associated with a lower risk of total mortality and stroke. \n \n However, the authors note that they were unable to specifically measure trans fat consumption — a potentially important limitation in the study. Cardiologists have recognized the specific danger of trans fats, which are artificial and also known as partially hydrogenated oils. Canada is moving toward banning trans fats — something New York City has already done in its restaurants and bakeries. \n \n There has been mounting scientific evidence over the last five years challenging the long-held notion that fat is to blame for cardiovascular disease and death, said Richard Bazinet, of the Department of Nutritional Sciences at the University of Toronto, who was not involved in the Lancet-published study. \n \n In the last couple of decades, that notion led to a slew of low-fat and fat-free products on grocery store shelves. \n \n The problem, Bazinet said, is many of those products contain high levels of sugar and carbohydrates, substituting other sources of calories that pose health risks. \n \n Richard Bazinet, a scientist with the Department of Nutritional Sciences at the University of Toronto, says the vast scope of the Lancet study adds to mounting evidence that fat is not the main cause of cardiovascular disease. (Keith Burgess/CBC) \n \n ""We\'re seeing that play out maybe with people thinking that things like juices are fine and sweetened, you know, foods that say low in fat are a great choice. A cookie\'s still a cookie even if it doesn\'t have saturated fat or high fat content."" \n \n Dehghan, the study\'s lead author, emphasized that the research looked solely at cardiovascular disease and mortality, and did not look at the effects of fats and carbohydrates on obesity — a health issue of particular concern in North America. \n \n According to Statistics Canada, more than half of adult Canadians were overweight or obese, based on body mass index (BMI), in 2014. \n \n Although Bazinet largely agrees with the study\'s findings, he said the constant onslaught of research focused on specific nutrients like fat or carbohydrates and ""blaming one versus the other"" may be ""missing the mark"" in educating the public on how to make healthy food choices. \n \n ""Moderation"" is the solution, he said. ""Don\'t eat too much of any single thing."" ', ' Low-fat diets could raise the risk of early death by almost one quarter, a major study has found. \n \n The Lancet study of 135,000 adults found those who cut back on fats had far shorter lives than those enjoying plenty of butter, cheese and meats. \n \n Researchers said the study was at odds with repeated health advice to cut down on fats. \n \n Those doing so tended to eat far too much stodgy food like bread, pasta and rice, the experts said, while missing out on vital nutrients. \n \n Participants eating the highest levels of carbohydrates – particularly refined sugars found in fizzy drinks and processed meals – faced a 28 per cent higher risk of early death. \n \n The NHS cautions against having too much saturated fat, on the grounds it raises cholesterol levels, increasing the risk of heart disease. \n \n But the latest research, presented at the European Society of Cardiology Congress, in Barcelona found those with low intake of saturated fat raised chances of early death by 13 per cent compared to those eating plenty. \n \n And consuming high levels of all fats cut mortality by up to 23 per cent. \n \n The Canadian study tracked eating patterns and death rates across 18 countries.']",2
"""Before cancer, I didn't know. Had I had yoga in my life, I would have been a lot less scared. I would have dealt with it a lot better. We want to share that with people. It's a mind/body connection. It helps get you get through it. It was a big part of my healing process.""

 Tabay Atkins, 11, had no inkling in 2012 that he had inadvertently selected his mission in life. He was 6. His mother was battling cancer. 
 
 The son of Larry Atkins and Sahel Anvarinejad observed first-hand the dramatic emotional and physical lift that his mother’s discovery of yoga contributed to her recovery from non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. 
 
 By year’s end, she was cancer-free and had completed a 200-hour certification as a yoga instructor. Tabay, being 6, tagged along at some of her training and soon found himself assimilating the flow. 
 
 Today, Tabay is a certified instructor – perhaps the youngest in America, or anywhere, as far as his mother can tell – having earned his Yoga Alliance certification last summer when he was still 10. 
 
 He doesn’t charge for his services. He puts out a donation jar, all proceeds going to children with cancer. 
 
 “He is the sweetest person you will ever meet,” said Taylor Carey, 11, who attended one of Tabay’s recent classes at the family’s studio, Care 4 Yoga, in San Clemente. 
 
 “When he told me he was an instructor, I said, really?” said Kim Hanley, who is Tabay’s sixth-grade English teacher at Vista Del Mar Middle School. She has been doing yoga for 16 years. She decided to try one of his classes. 
 
 “I had a hard time not crying the whole time,” she said. “He did so well. He said all the right things at all the right times. He taught me a few new tricks today. Very impressive. Sixteen years and I learned something new today.” 
 
 Yoga may seem an unusual passion for the nimble 79-pound son of a retired 6-foot-3, 250-pound National Football League linebacker. But Larry Atkins, formerly of the Kansas City Chiefs and Oakland Raiders, said he is proud of his son and is sold on yoga. 
 
 “It has benefitted me a lot,” he said. “I wish I had started this early on, when I was playing. Now my body is a lot more flexible than it ever was. This takes it to another level, not only physically but mentally.” 
 
 Tabay said his mother lost her hair to chemotherapy and couldn’t walk on her own in 2012. He watched her take up yoga and dive into training intensely. “She healed mentally and physically,” Tabay said. “She could walk on her own.” 
 
 Once certified, Sahel began teaching. She also began offering yoga for physical education in Tabay’s second-grade class at Concordia Elementary School, earning specialty certificates to teach children, teens, cancer survivors and children with autism or other special needs. Tabay accompanied her at some of these trainings. Attending one in its entirety, he so impressed the teacher that she certified him in that specialty. 
 
 Tabay began assisting his mom at her classes. “At first I was a little nervous,” he said. “After a while, it’s easier to do.” 
 
 When he graduated fifth grade, his mother offered him a summer trip to Europe or an intensive 200-hour full yoga instructor certification course in Los Angeles. Europe will have to wait. 
 
 Madeline Macchia, 11, who has known Tabay since the first grade and practiced yoga since then, said there isn’t much difference between Tabay’s classes and his mom’s. “I love being around them,” she said. “He has gained a lot more knowledge about yoga and has definitely grown as a teacher.” 
 
 “You could tell he had something special, teaching,” said Rachel Pattin, 13. “He was like a little version of his mom. He has like the happiness ... and the kid energy. He’s a lot of fun.” 
 
 As word about the 11-year-old yogi has spread, the Atkins family has suddenly found itself fielding inquiries from news reporters and television stations. Tabay said he has upcoming travel dates for tapings of TV shows he isn’t at liberty to divulge. 
 
 “He is an amazing boy,” his mother said. “He touches everyone’s heart. He has love for everyone and wants to share that. He wants to help people who are sick.” 
 
 Sahel said the donations her son collects to go to Children’s Hospital of Orange County, to cancer families the Atkins family knows or to a basket of other charities they are confident will apply the proceeds well. 
 
 “I am with him 100 percent,” said his dad. “I played professional sports – what I did was temporary ... a few years, and then it’s over. What he is doing can last a lifetime. He can do a lot more than I did, as far as inspiring people.”

 By Eric Heinz 
 
 He laid still on a yoga mat in the middle of the center, eyes closed and giving soft directions to his students. 
 
 The preteen teacher cultivated a Zen atmosphere by meditative recitation during a recent yoga class. 
 
 Larry Tabay Atkins IV, from San Clemente, is 11 years old and already has four different certifications in yoga in different disciplines. He goes by his middle name, Tabay. 
 
 Tabay has two circus yoga certificates (acrobatic yoga), one mild to severe autism certificate, and a 200-hour adult teacher training certificate, which he obtained Aug. 1. 
 
 “During the summer, my mom gave me the choice to either go to Europe or go to Paris and London,” Tabay said. “Instead, I said I’d like to do a 200-hour teacher training (course). I said so I could help other people, like yoga helped her.”

 Sahel Anvarinejad, Tabay’s mother, had cancer a few years ago. She said going through treatment made it difficult to walk, let alone do yoga. As she recovered from treatment, Anvarinejad did her own 200-hour teaching course. 
 
 “Emotionally, I just broke down,” Anvarinejad said. “Tabay saw that yoga was helping physically and mentally. So… he said many people have cancer and don’t know how to do yoga, and he said he wanted to share it with as many people as possible and help them heal.” 
 
 Anvarinejad said she has been cancer-free for four years. She said she wasn’t surprised that Tabay wanted to do the 200-hour course. 
 
 “All throughout the year he had been saying he wanted to do it,” Anvarinejad said. “So I gave him the choice, and I was a little surprised because he loves to travel, but he was very eager to get the certificate.” 
 
 Throughout his training, Tabay had to learn a plethora of poses and how to teach the correct form. He said the classes taught him to differentiate between popular poses that are often incorrectly done and how to correct practitioners’ form. 
 
 “I’ve been doing yoga for years now, and the training was very intense, but it was worth it,” he said. “We had to answer a lot of questions and do midterms and finals. During the last part of the yoga training, I wasn’t feeling very well. But I didn’t want to quit.” 
 
 Anvarinejad said she thinks Tabay is one of—if not, the—youngest yoga instructor in the country based on some research she did online and a news cast on a 12-year-old girl that claimed she was the youngest person. Either way, India’s Shruti Pandey was 6 years old when she started teaching. 
 
 “It helps people with so many different things, with stress, work, family, relationships, health and not a lot of people know that,” Anvarinejad said. 
 
 Tabay said he wants to teach yoga around the world and develop his own brand or company dedicated to spreading education in yoga. His entrepreneurial spirit is calling him to open as many yoga studios as possible. 
 
 “Some of the kids from (his middle school) class have stress from school, and it really helps them deal with that stress,” Tabay said. 
 
 Tabay wants to do a third certification in circus yoga, but he said it’s easier to teach children his own age as he can relate to them. On Wednesdays, Tabay hosts a LEGO yoga therapy session, which involves using the toy building blocks as a way to center themselves. 
 
 Anvarinejad said in order to keep children focused and involved in yoga, it takes a certain level of skill. The classes must continue to move on different skill sets to address breathing patterns and the different types of stress adults and children deal with. 
 
 Bahar Amjaei, Anvarinejad’s close friend, said she’s known Tabay since he was little, and she stuck with his mother through her bout with cancer. 
 
 “I’ve never done yoga before and today was my first time,” Amjaei said. “I thought Tabay did a great job, and I’d like to come back again.” 
 
 Anvarinejad has a wall full of yoga certifications of her own. 
 
 Amjaei said she thinks yoga has brought Tabay and his mother closer together. 
 
 “I saw Sahel doing yoga four years ago and Tabay was very involved and very patient and very interested,” Amjaei said. 
 
 Tabay’s father, Larry Atkins III, was a linebacker in the NFL for a few years. Atkins III said he’s noticed his own physical improvements after taking up yoga. 
 
 “Being an athlete and going through physical training, when he took me through his sessions, it was up there with some of the toughest things I’ve had to do physically,” Atkins III said. “I was surprised how hard it was, but at the same time (I enjoyed) how good it is for you. I’ve never really been through it before, but after going through it with him I wish it was something I had done a long time ago.” 
 
 Atkins III said he tried to keep up as best he could. 
 
 “I’m with him 100 percent with him with whatever he wants to do to support him,” Atkins III said. “It’s a great accomplishment, as far as what he’s been doing, and just his heart. He has a genuine heart, and he truly is an amazing kid. I think his energy just lifts everyone up.” 
 
 Kim Hanley, a teacher at Vista Del Mar Middle School, has been practicing yoga for 16 years and is Tabay’s English teacher 
 
 “It was fun for me to be his student,” Hanley said. “He’s got this peaceful demeanor in class, kind of like (what you’d expect of) a yoga instructor. He’s very calm and focused in class. He does what he needs to do, and he’s a great student.” 
 
 Hanley said she learned a couple things about Vinyasa yoga in the class. 
 
 John Castillo, who participated in the class on Saturday, said his daughter had been taking classes from care4yoga for years. 
 
 “Just realizing every time I do yoga, it makes me feel better, and I’d like to come back,” Castillo said of why he sat in on the class. 
 
 Sarah and Alexa Castillo, John’s daughters, said they also enjoyed the classes. 
 
 Madeline Macchia, a sixth-grader, said the class was fun and exciting. 
 
 “I was really excited to see Tabay do all these special things and be recognized for all he has done,” Macchia said. “Every time I come here, I just know that I’m going to be happy for the rest of the day. It helps me think.”","– Eleven-year-old Tabay Atkins was given a choice upon graduating fifth grade last year: a trip to Europe or a 200-hour yoga instructor certification course. He went with the yoga. The Orange County Register reports Tabay may very well now be the youngest certified yoga instructor in America, leading classes at his family's yoga studio in San Clemente, Calif. Tabay tells the San Clemente Times the classes help some of his peers from school deal with their stress. One of his 13-year-old students likes that Tabay brings ""the happiness...and the kid energy"" during his yoga classes. But Tabay isn't just teaching kids. A middle-school teacher and 16-year yoga veteran says Tabay even taught her a few new tricks. Tabay was introduced to yoga in 2012 when his mom, Sahel Anvarinejad, was battling cancer. She realized yoga helped her in that battle and got her own instructor certification while recovering. Tabay says that as a 6-year-old he realized yoga helped heal his mom ""mentally and physically."" Now he says he wants to ""help other people, like yoga helped her.""

"Pete DiMartino assisted his then-fiancee, Rebekah Gregory, with a brace to help her walk down the aisle during their wedding ceremony last March. 
 
 More than a year and a half after the Boston Marathon attack, a 27-year-old Texas woman who was severely injured in the first blast underwent surgery Monday to amputate her left leg below the knee. 
 
 Rebekah DiMartino’s decision to amputate came after more than 15 previous operations in Boston and Houston aimed at saving the limb. It made her at least the 17th person to lose a leg as a result of the April 2013 attack, but the first apparently since the life-saving surgeries that immediately followed the traumatic bombing.

 Doctors said DiMartino’s choice reflects the continued struggle some of the critically injured survivors have faced in trying to regain mobility and minimize pain over the past 19 months. 
 
 With what has become her trademark optimism and humor, DiMartino held a “Left Leg Last Hurrah” dinner over the weekend and posted a break-up note to her leg on her public 
 
 Facebook page, along with a photo in which she had written “It’s Not You It’s Me” across her heavily scarred foot, ankle, and shin — above one final pedicure.

 “Today is the day I say goodbye to what is holding me back, and I reclaim my life,” she wrote hours before heading into surgery, thanking friends, family, and the public for support. 
 
 Eric Kayne Rebekah Gregory is seen in a photograph from June 13, 2013, taken in Richmond, Texas. 
 
 On Monday night, her orthopedic surgeon, Dr. William McGarvey, said the hourlong surgery at Memorial Hermann Katy Hospital west of Houston was successful. 
 
 “There were no hiccups,” McGarvey said, in a phone interview immediately after the surgery. “Having spoken with Rebekah for the last several months, I think she’s going to do well. She’s got a great attitude, and I think for her, this is sort of a reconstructive procedure as opposed to an elimination procedure.”

 McGarvey said DiMartino’s decision was driven by the acute, persistent pain that has forced her to rely on a wheelchair, crutches, and leg brace and limited her ability to live a normal life with her 7-year-old son, Noah, and husband Pete, both of whom were also wounded in the attack. 
 
 He said she should gain smooth movement with a below-the-knee prosthesis and hoped her pain would ultimately vanish, but it may persist. “As a result of the blast injury, she clearly had skeletal trauma, she clearly had muscular trauma, but she also had neurological injury, and that’s probably the thing we have the least control over,” McGarvey said. 
 
 Dr. Edward Rodriguez, the trauma surgeon who initially treated DiMartino at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, said “limb salvage” patients — those who elect with their care teams to try to save damaged limbs — can sometimes have a more complex, painful trajectory than those who lose limbs immediately from trauma. 
 
 “It’s very sad that it took this long to reach this point, but I think it’s important that you don’t see this as a failure,” Rodriguez said. “It’s not that she failed to keep her leg. She had a leg that wasn’t working for her, so it could be a success.” 
 
 DiMartino — then Rebekah Gregory — was a divorced single mother when she met Pete DiMartino, a construction worker and bartender, on a business trip in upstate New York in 2012 while traveling for her job as membership sales manager for a private-clubs association. They were dating long distance when she joined DiMartino and his family in Boston to watch his mother run the 2013 Marathon. They gathered to cheer her at the 17-mile mark before jumping on the MBTA to root her on again on Boylston Street, site of the bombings. 
 
 Pete DiMartino lost the majority of his right Achilles tendon and suffered multiple broken bones, burns, and cuts, while Noah, then 5, emerged with a bad leg cut and shrapnel in the back of his head, according to previous reports. Noah left the hospital in five days, and by late May Pete was well enough to throw out the first pitch at a Red Sox game. But Rebekah spent five-plus weeks at Beth Israel before transferring to Spaulding Rehab, where it became clear that she needed more surgery. 
 
 Even in those two days at Spaulding, she made a strong impression on the staff with her positive outlook and close connection to her young son, said Dr. David Crandell, medical director for the Spaulding Rehabilitation Network’s amputee program. She transferred from Spaulding to Houston for further surgery and rehabilitation, and to be with her son and parents. 
 
 Gregory and DiMartino married last spring in Asheville, N.C., after winning wedding website TheKnot.com’s 2014 Dream Wedding contest. 
 
 Crandell said he has treated patients who have ultimately elected amputation after even a decade of trying to save a damaged limb. 
 
 “People mourn the loss of a limb just like a loved one, but if you’re truly focusing on function, the reality may become, with quality care and rehabilitation, that they may do better” with amputation, said Crandell, who advised One Fund Boston’s second round of distributed aid last summer. 
 
 The One Fund’s initial distribution of $61 million in 2013 gave $1.2 million to each survivor who lost one limb, and less — $125,000 to nearly $950,000 — to 69 others who were hospitalized for at least one night, based exclusively on how long they were hospitalized. DiMartino’s extended hospitalization would have put her at the top of that range. But the second round of One Fund awards, totaling nearly $19 million this summer, took into account the potential for future amputation as well as lifelong need and other factors. 
 
 DiMartino had planned just a brief visit to Boston in 2013 when her life was altered at the Marathon. She formed close relationships with her Beth Israel team; some of her nurses attended her wedding, and at least one planned to fly to Texas Tuesday to see her. 
 
 That nurse, Tracy Kiss, was photographed holding DiMartino’s hand as the survivor crossed the finish line of the Marathon last April in a wheelchair. DiMartino has set a goal to run the next Marathon on a new prosthesis. McGarvey, the surgeon, said it may be possible. “Based on what I’ve seen and the amount of commitment she’s put into everything she’s done to this point, and the attitude she has, I wouldn’t doubt it for a minute,” he said.

 DiMartino was with her son, Noah, and then-boyfriend, Pete DiMartino, at the finish line of the city's iconic road race when the blasts went off on April 15, 2013. They were all wounded in the attack, but Rebekah's injuries were the most serious, with doctors opting to try to salvage her limb. 
 
 Pete, now her husband, said later Monday that the below-the-knee amputation at Memorial Hermann Katy Hospital outside Houston was a success. Rebekah joins at least 16 other survivors of the attack who had amputations because of the blasts. 
 
 ""The fact that I was given a second chance at life that day is something that I will never again take for granted,"" DiMartino, 27, told NBC News on Saturday ahead of the surgery. ""If I have to lose my leg in that process, so be it, because I'm still here."" 
 
 Since the attack, DiMartino has had multiple procedures within the 17 operations, including the transplant of live muscle from her back to her wounded left foot and the installation of metal plates, screws and rods. She suffered a serious bone infection from the blast, as well as the loss of her fourth and fifth metatarsals on her left foot and a lot of tissue from her left leg, and she was on bed rest for several months. 
 
 ""I've never been a runner, an outdoors person, but now I want to climb mountains, I want to run marathons. I want to do anything and everything that you can do with your legs, because it makes me appreciate them so much more now."" 
 
 DiMartino has spent a lot of time in a wheelchair, having had limited ability to walk — with even short attempts at wearing a boot leaving her exhausted and hurting. Pain has been her constant companion, one she is hoping to leave behind with the amputation. 
 
 ""Even though my leg is being chopped off and I won't be able to walk for a while, it's still a step forward to me,"" she said, noting that the debut of her next chapter was ""such a relief."" 
 
 Her physician, Dr. Bill McGarvey, said there were still conventional and non-conventional options for DiMartino to pursue with her leg, but he understood she had settled on having the amputation. It's not a given, however, that she will have relief from the pain by having the surgery. 
 
 ""I can't guarantee that,"" said McGarvey, an orthopedic surgeon at Memorial Hermann. ""The difficult part about this is that there is sometimes an unpredictability that goes along with these procedures — persistent pain, function and all the things that you would expect.

 ""The assumption is that you take away the leg and all the problems go away, and it's not that simple,"" he added, noting issues could arise over prosthetic fitting, wear and practice, for example. 
 
 DiMartino is aware of the possible downsides but has also watched as other amputees have moved on with their lives. She wants to do the same and said she has set goals ""that push you beyond your limits and get you out of your comfort zone,"" like participating in next year's Boston Marathon and competing in a triathlon to honor her late grandfather. 
 
 ""I've never been a runner, an outdoors person, but now I want to climb mountains, I want to run marathons. I want to do anything and everything that you can do with your legs, because it makes me appreciate them so much more now,"" she said. ""I still have a lot of living left to do."" 
 
 McGarvey said that if all goes well, DiMartino could be taking her first steps three months after the operation. 
 
 ""I think this is something she is committed to, and I think that with that kind of attitude and drive that she'll actually do very, very well,"" he said. ""If we can get rid of the pain for her, I have no doubt that she's going to be successful."" 
 
 McGarvey said later Monday that the surgery went well, with no surprises, though he did encounter some small shrapnel – remnants of the blast – in the area where he was removing the limb. DiMartino was awake about 30 minutes after the surgery and will spend a few days in the hospital before going home to recuperate, he said. 
 
 DiMartino said she knew the bid to salvage her lower left leg had been difficult on her family, too, who were hopeful she could keep it. Noah, now 7 years old, would cry when she tried to speak to him about the amputation. But in recent days, he has come around to the idea, she said, even deciding that getting a prosthetic was the ""coolest thing"" because she would become a ""half-robot mom."" 
 
 There have been tough emotional days for her as well, DiMartino said, noting that she constantly recalls the woman who died next to her (one of three people who were killed in the bombings) at the finish line, the sound of the blasts and the aftermath. 
 
 ""I wonder if that's going to stay with me for the rest of my life, but that same thing keeps me very grounded, and it keeps me very motivated, because if I stop now, it means the terrorists have won, and they will never win,"" she said. 
 
 Although it has been a hard journey, DiMartino has had much to celebrate: her marriage to Pete around the one-year anniversary of the attack and their settling into a new home with Noah near her parents in Richmond, Texas. Pete has taken up woodworking, and Rebekah, who used to work in corporate housing, is beginning to do motivational speaking — a calling she found after the bombings. 
 
 This weekend was what DiMartino called her ""Left Leg Last Hurrah"" — a celebration of the future, rather than a somber goodbye. 
 
 She has no regrets about the last year and a half, saying it taught her what it is like to live as a disabled person and brought many new friends into her life. This week, two nurses who cared for her in Boston will be at her side, and other Boston Marathon amputees have offered their help. 
 
 This weekend was what DiMartino called her ""Left Leg Last Hurrah"" — a celebration of the future, rather than a somber goodbye. 
 
 ""This is a new beginning for me. This is when the rest of my life starts. I've been in a limbo state for so long now that it really is going to be what pushes me forward and what allows me to be able to live my life to the fullest,"" she said. ""It's OK. It really just is a leg."" 
 
 Gallery:Injured Couple Creates New Life After Bombing","– A 27-year-old survivor of the Boston Marathon bombings had her leg amputated yesterday after 17 operations to try to save it, reports NBC News. But to get a sense of Rebekah DiMartino's state of mind, it's better to check out her Facebook post prior to the operation in which she writes a ""Dear John"" letter of sorts to her own leg informing it of their pending breakup. ""Go get yourself one last pedicure on me and enjoy it because tomorrow ... I will be cutting you out of my life for good,"" she writes. On a photo of her leg, she adds, ""It's not you, it's me,"" notes the Boston Globe. It's typical of the upbeat attitude with which DiMartino—who was Rebekah Gregory at the time of the bombings—has handled her recovery from the start. Martino's then-boyfriend, Pete DiMartino, and son Noah, then 5, also were wounded in the bombings, but they suffered lesser injuries. She and DiMartino have since married and now live in Texas, and she has become a motivational speaker. ""This is a new beginning for me,"" she told NBC over the weekend. ""It's OK.

She wants to do the same and said she has set goals ""that push you beyond your limits and get you out of your comfort zone,"" like participating in next year\'s Boston Marathon and competing in a triathlon to honor her late grandfather. \n \n ""I\'ve never been a runner, an outdoors person, but now I want to climb mountains, I want to run marathons.

""If we can get rid of the pain for her, I have no doubt that she\'s going to be successful."" \n \n McGarvey said later Monday that the surgery went well, with no surprises, though he did encounter some small shrapnel – remnants of the blast – in the area where he was removing the limb. DiMartino was awake about 30 minutes after the surgery and will spend a few days in the hospital before going home to recuperate, he said. \n \n DiMartino said she knew the bid to salvage her lower left leg had been difficult on her family, too, who were hopeful she could keep it.

But in recent days, he has come around to the idea, she said, even deciding that getting a prosthetic was the ""coolest thing"" because she would become a ""half-robot mom."" \n \n There have been tough emotional days for her as well, DiMartino said, noting that she constantly recalls the woman who died next to her (one of three people who were killed in the bombings) at the finish line, the sound of the blasts and the aftermath. \n \n ""I wonder if that\'s going to stay with me for the rest of my life, but that same thing keeps me very grounded, and it keeps me very motivated, because if I stop now, it means the terrorists have won, and they will never win,"" she said. \n \n Although it has been a hard journey, DiMartino has had much to celebrate: her marriage to Pete around the one-year anniversary of the attack and their settling into a new home with Noah near her parents in Richmond, Texas. Pete has taken up woodworking, and Rebekah, who used to work in corporate housing, is beginning to do motivational speaking — a calling she found after the bombings. \n \n This weekend was what DiMartino called her ""Left Leg Last Hurrah"" — a celebration of the future, rather than a somber goodbye. \n \n She has no regrets about the last year and a half, saying it taught her what it is like to live as a disabled person and brought many new friends into her life. This week, two nurses who cared for her in Boston will be at her side, and other Boston Marathon amputees have offered their help. \n \n This weekend was what DiMartino called her ""Left Leg Last Hurrah"" — a celebration of the future, rather than a somber goodbye. \n \n ""This is a new beginning for me.

"LONDON A British woman who tried to kill her husband by poisoning his Christmas drink of sparkling fruit wine with anti-freeze was jailed for 15 years on Monday after being undone by a spelling mistake and a trail of text messages. 
 
 Following family arguments, Jacqueline Patrick, 55, twice tried to kill her husband Douglas, 70, in October and on Christmas Day 2013, by spiking his cherry Lambrini, a drink favored by teenagers looking to get drunk on a low budget. 
 
 ""Perhaps most shocking of all was the note she gave to the London Ambulance Service purporting to be from her husband, stating that he did not wish to be resuscitated,"" said Detective Inspector Tracey Miller, of London's Metropolitan Police, in a statement. 
 
 The forged note showed a misspelling of the word dignity as ""dignerty"". When police later asked her to write the word, Jacqueline Patrick made the same mistake. 
 
 The couple's daughter Katherine, 21, was sentenced to three years in jail after admitting to inciting her mother to poison her father, while Jacqueline pleaded guilty to two counts of attempted murder at the family's south London home. 
 
 Douglas Patrick was rushed to hospital fighting for his life, and tests revealed he was suffering from anti-freeze poisoning.

 A woman has been jailed for attempting to murder her husband by spiking his cherry Lambrini drink with anti-freeze on Christmas Day. 
 
 
 
 Jacqueline Patrick, 55, was encouraged by her daughter, Katherine, 21, to poison Douglas Patrick, who was left fighting for his life after collapsing at the family home in Gipsy Hill, south London. 
 
 
 
 His wife gave ambulance staff a fake “do not resuscitate” note after he was rushed to hospital on Boxing Day 2013, the court heard. 
 
 
 
 He had already survived an earlier attempt by her to kill him the previous October. 
 
 Jacqueline Patrick pleaded guilty last month to two counts of attempted murder and Katherine admitted a charge of inciting another to administer a noxious substance.

 The mother was given a sentence of 15 years for each charge, to be served concurrently, and her daughter received a three-year jail sentence. 
 
 
 
 Sam Brown, prosecuting, told Inner London crown court: “There was a concerted plan and persistent attempt by Jacqueline Patrick to murder Douglas. It was carried out in autumn and winter with the effect to be achieved over a period of time. 
 
 “It was hoped that the lethal dose and effects could be disguised as an adverse reaction to medication during that period or as a consequence of an attempt to take his own life. Douglas Patrick had no intention of harming himself and never did. 
 
 “Katherine Patrick knew and was aware that her mother was intending to administer to her father poison and encouraged her knowing she she would be endangering his life. Who can say what the reason was?” 
 
 The couple had been married for almost 30 years and had two children: Katherine, known as Katie, and an older daughter. 
 
 
 
 The court heard there had been domestic problems within the family concerning the younger daughter’s boyfriend, but allegations about her father being abusive or violent had been dropped. 
 
 Katherine Patrick had been “physically chastised” by her father as a child and had become “overly reliant” on her mother, her defence lawyer said. Julia Flanagan described her client as a “sensitive and timid girl” and said a psychological report found her to be “not as mature as others of her age”. 
 
 Her mother poured anti-freeze into the a bottle of cherry perry and poured her husband about two-and-a-half glasses of it as she served him supper after a family argument on Christmas Day, the court was told. 
 
 
 
 When he became ill the next morning she phoned the ambulance and told them that he had previously had kidney failure and that a couple of drinks the previous day had caused the condition to “flare up again”. 
 
 
 
 She then faked a note from her husband that said he did not wish to be revived and wanted to die in dignity with his family by his side. He spent several days in an induced coma before having to learn to walk and talk again during a year of rehabilitation. 
 
 In a statement read to the court, Douglas Patrick said: “I will never get over it. It broke me. I’m just a shell now. This was a person I was married to for over 25 years. A person I loved and love.” 
 
 The court heard that he had not wanted to pursue a case against his wife and daughter and did not want to see them put in prison, or have the incident “hang over their heads”. 
 
 
 
 Judge Nic Madge told Jacqueline Patrick: “There were clearly premeditated and planned attempts to kill your husband. With a cold and calculated determination, you bought the anti-freeze, you administered that poison twice.” 
 
 The judge added that Katherine Patrick “did more” than simply not stop her mother. 
 
","– Here's one reason you might want to pay attention to your spelling lessons, kids: They may come in handy one day should you ever want to ... poison your husband? Behold, the strange case of Jacqueline Patrick. The 55-year-old British woman tried to fatally poison her husband not once, but twice, back in 2013 by putting anti-freeze in his wine, Reuters reports. After the second attempt, she handed the ambulance drivers a note that, she claimed, he had written. In it, her 70-year-old ""husband"" asked not to be resuscitated because he wanted to die with ""dignerty."" Police, noticing the misspelling, asked Patrick to spell the word ""dignity,"" and she misspelled it as ""dignerty,"" thus providing the fateful clue. Patrick ended up being arrested and, on Monday, sent to jail for 15 years after she pleaded guilty to two counts of attempted murder, the Guardian reports. The couple's 21-year-old daughter also admitted to urging her mother to poison dear old dad (who ultimately survived), and was sentenced to three years in jail. Also not helping their case were text messages between the mother and daughter that said things like, ""I got the stuff I will give him some later delete txt tell no one ok"" and ""He feels sick again I gave him more delete this.""

"Naresh Jain, desccribed as the ""Hawala King"" for his alleged dominance of the secret informal banking system used by terrorists and gangsters to bypass legitimate channels, was being tracked by detectives in Britain, the United States and Italy and Dubai when he was seized in New Delhi on Sunday. 
 
 Detectives described Mr Jain himself as one of the world's biggest money lenders who, along with his associates, was believed to operate a $2.2 billion (£1.3 billion) money-laundering scheme. 
 
 When detectives raided the Jain family home in Delhi in September, they allegedly found details of electronic bank transfers to beneficiaries in Afghanistan and Pakistan, records of phone calls to crime figures in those countries and around £75,000 in cash. He was arrested on Sunday by detectives from India's Narcotics Control Bureau and accused of laundering the proceeds of drugs trafficking. 
 
 Mr Jain has denied all the charges, claiming that he is a legitimate businessman who is being framed. 
 
 But police allege that they discovered records of 35 companies, all established by Mr Jain and his two Delhi-based brothers, and records of secret hawala transfers. 
 
 Detectives claimed Mr Jain's involvement in halawa banking was just one aspect of his alleged money laundering empire and that he used ""any means at his disposal"" to disguise the source and purpose of his money transfers. 
 
 His network, built up over 20 years, is believed to span five continents. It suffered its first setback in 2006, when Italian police mounted a sting operation which netted many of his key contacts in the country but failed to land Mr Jain himself. 
 
 Mr Jain was arrested in Dubai in 2007 for breaking the emirate's foreign exchange laws, but was released the following year and returned to India. 
 
 ""He operated beyond cultural barriers, money-laundering for various major criminal networks, and his arrest is hugely significant,"" said one police source. ||||| Naresh Jain was being tracked by detectives in London, the United States, Holland, Italy, Spain and the UAE when he was seized in New Delhi. 
 
 He is accused of acting as a money launderer for organised crime gangs from British drug traffickers to al Qaida suspects. 
 
 Jain fled his business headquarters in Dubai last year after being released on bail ahead of a trial for breaking the country's foreign exchange laws. 
 
 Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) deputy director Ian Cruxton said he was held by officers of the Narcotics Control Bureau in India yesterday after a year-long manhunt. 
 
 He said: ""This operation is part of Soca's long term strategy targeting specialist money launderers based overseas."" 
 
 Jain, also known as Naresh Patel, was arrested in April 2007 by Dubai police after a year-long international investigation. 
 
 Officials believe he controlled a worldwide money laundering system that at its height was capable of moving $2.2bn (£1.3bn) a year. 
 
 This business consisted of individuals and companies that facilitated the collection and distribution of cash in key cities across five continents. 
 
 From his Dubai office Jain was allegedly able to provide his criminal clients with funds in a jurisdiction of their choice. 
 
 Much of the money was moved by hawala, an informal honour-based money transfer system primarily based in the Middle East, East Africa and southern Asia. 
 
 The British authorities have secured an exclusion order preventing Jain from entering the UK. 
 
 Mr Cruxton added: ""The illegal informal value transfer systems they use provide the infrastructure to launder cash for organised crime groups whose activities directly impact on the United Kingdom.

"With New Orleans poised to score on its opening possession, Donte Whitner delivered a crushing blow that knocked out running back Pierre Thomas and forced the first of five Saints turnovers.

 San Francisco's hard-hitting, opportunistic defense set the tone in the 49ers' thrilling 36-32 playoff win the same way it has all season. 
 
 From Justin Smith and Aldon Smith harassing Drew Brees all day, to Patrick Willis and NaVorro Bowman shutting down the running game and Dashon Goldson making punishing hits and key plays from the secondary, the defense is the biggest reason for the resurgence in San Francisco that has the 49ers (14-3) back in the NFC championship for the first time since the 1997 season. 
 
 They will play the Giants next Sunday at Candlestick Park after New York defeated the defending Super Bowl champion Green Bay Packers 37-20 on Sunday. San Francisco beat Eli Manning and the Giants 27-20 at home Nov. 13. 
 
 ""It's a lot better than traveling to Wisconsin. More importantly, we're playing a team we've already faced,"" cornerback Carlos Rogers said Sunday. ""It's not as hard as preparing for another team we haven't faced yet."" 
 
 ""Home game huh?"" Whitner tweeted Sunday once his opponent had been determined. 
 
 An offensive show featuring four lead changes defined the final five minutes of the Niners' win Saturday, capped by Alex Smith's 14-yard touchdown pass to Vernon Davis with 9 seconds remaining. But Whitner got things going in the franchise's first postseason appearance in nine years. 
 
 ""It let the (Saints) offense know we were going to be physical all day,"" Whitner said of the hit on Thomas, who left with a head injury and never returned. 
 
 Whitner was unfazed by his pass interference penalty moments earlier that briefly sent shaken-up tight end Jimmy Graham to the sideline. Whitner's jarring, legal helmet-to-helmet hit on Thomas was a blow to the Saints' psyche as well as to their depth chart. 
 
 The 49ers defense has been so stingy this season they didn't allow a 100-yard runner or a rushing touchdown until the second-to-last game of the year Dec. 24 at Seattle. Hall of Famer Ronnie Lott, part of plenty of top-notch defenses himself, has praised these men for not ""giving up inches."" 
 
 ""We've got a great defense. We feel like we can stop anyone,"" Bowman said. ""When it's not working for our offense, it's our job to get the ball back for them as many times as we can. That's all it was. If those guys aren't doing well it's our job to pick it up. That's what a team is and I think we have a great one here."" 
 
 First-year coach Jim Harbaugh brought defensive coordinator Vic Fangio along with him from Stanford when he was hired last January _ and Fangio has developed his unit into one of the NFL's best. 
 
 ""We like to think that we play defense the right way,"" Fangio said. ""We play physical, we play with our hands. We run to the ball. We don't try and do anything too fancy, although we do have our changeups here and there. We try and play defense the old-fashioned, hard school way."" 
 
 The Niners had 38 takeaways during the regular season to only 10 turnovers. Their plus-28 turnover differential matched the 2010 Patriots for the second-best mark in NFL history since 1941. 
 
 They forced five more Saturday, and only had one turnover themselves. 
 
 San Francisco's determined defenders heard all week how difficult it would be to stop Brees and Co., knowing many figured they'd fail. 
 
 ""We got tired of it throughout the week. They gave us no chance,"" Goldson said. ""They kept talking about the Saints, the Saints, where they stand against us and what they were going to do. We ignored everything and focused on us and what we had to do to come win this game."" 
 
 Goldson had six interceptions for the NFC West champions during the regular season, then his biggest yet Saturday. That first-quarter pick snapped Brees' NFL-record streak of 226 postseason passes without an interception dating to the NFC championship game against Chicago five years ago. 
 
 Tarell Brown had the other interception, while special teams standouts Blake Costanzo and Madieu Williams each forced a fumble. 
 
 ""Our guys were humming. We were able to pry a couple out and that was big,"" Fangio said. ""The interceptions were big also."" 
 
 The Niners were No. 1 in the NFL in stopping the run during the season and didn't allow a rushing TD on Saturday after the Saints scored three on the ground in a 45-28 win over the Detroit Lions in the Superdome in last weekend's wild-card round. 
 
 The Saints produced a playoff-record 626 yards against the Lions, with Brees throwing for 466 yards while completing 33 of 43 passes. 
 
 ""I had figured coming into this game they would feel like, `Let's keep everything in front of us, let's not give up big plays and obviously do a good job against the rush and try to put them in third-and-long situations,'"" Brees said. ""They did, yet again, a great job stopping the run in a lot of cases which we felt like in order to really get chunks, we would have to throw it. Obviously that's a great defense. It's one of the best defenses in the league."" 
 
 Goldson was re-signed to a one-year contract as a free agent in August to complement newcomers and fellow defensive backs Whitner and Carlos Rogers. Against the Saints, Goldson had a team-leading 11 tackles to go with the first-quarter interception and two passes defensed. Bowman also made 11 tackles, 10 of those solo. 
 
 ""We got some spectacular stops,"" Harbaugh said. ""On third down, I thought they were outstanding. Five takeaways in the game. I know the special teams contributed to that as well. Very opportunistic today. Got pressure on their quarterback. Made plays on the ball, and made them when they were there to be made. Our guys in the secondary made them. It was a terrific job by our defense, once again. You just love the way they play. You love the way they compete. Love how hard they work on the field."" 
 
 The 49ers sacked the record-setting Brees three times, including rookie Aldon Smith's pounding for an 11-yard loss on third down in the first quarter. All-Pro defensive tackle Justin Smith brought Brees to the ground for a 9-yard loss in the third quarter and Ahmad Brooks added a fourth-quarter sack on which Brees lost 7 yards. 
 
 ""We wanted to come out and play our style of football, which is playing physical, being a great tackling team, and playing with good fundamentals which has carried us all year,"" Fangio said. ""We just wanted to play the way we've played all year, particularly starting early in the game."" 
 
 Whitner definitely did his part. 
 
 ""I told myself that I was going to hit anything moving today and that I was going to be extremely physical, even if I hit my own guys,"" he said. ""Luckily, I didn't hit too many of my own guys."" ||||| If style points and offensive fireworks meant anything, the Baltimore Ravens wouldn't stand a chance of making it to the AFC championship.

 Playing defense and protecting the football are what they do best, and that formula led to a 20-13 victory over the Houston Texans on Sunday, putting Baltimore in the AFC title game against the New England Patriots. 
 
 ""I always say there is a right way to do things, there is a wrong way to do things and there is just the Ravens' way of doing things,"" linebacker Terrell Suggs said. ""It wasn't pretty but we're not really a pretty team. We got the W and now it's on to the AFC championship."" 
 
 The Ravens (13-4) had almost as many punts (nine) as first downs (11) and scored only three points over the final 46 minutes. But Baltimore wasn't penalized once, didn't commit a turnover, intercepted rookie quarterback T.J. Yates three times and totaled four takeaways _ two in the first quarter and two over the final eight minutes. 
 
 ""If we didn't get any of those turnovers it would probably be a different game,"" Ravens defensive tackle Haloti Ngata said. 
 
 Baltimore visits New England next Sunday, with the winner advancing to the Super Bowl in Indianapolis on Feb. 5. 
 
 The Patriots lead the series 6-1, but Baltimore's lone win came in the postseason. 
 
 ""We don't play the game until next week,"" Suggs said. ""I'm going to enjoy tonight."" 
 
 Veteran defensive stars Ed Reed and Ray Lewis led a unit that yielded only one touchdown and came up with the big play when one was needed. Lewis had a team-high seven tackles and Reed sealed the victory with the Ravens' fourth takeaway, an interception near the goal line in the closing minutes. 
 
 ""It's winning by any means necessary,"" Reed said. ""That's what it's got to be."" 
 
 The Ravens finished 9-0 at home, but this one was anything but easy. Baltimore led 17-3 after the first quarter, and interceptions by Lardarius Webb and Reed in the final 7 1/2 minutes helped the advantage stand up. 
 
 Reed has eight interceptions in 10 playoff games, few bigger than the last one. 
 
 ""You can't say enough about him,"" Ravens linebacker Jarret Johnson said. ""His big plays always seem to happen when you need one."" 
 
 One week earlier, in the first playoff game in Texans history, Houston didn't commit a turnover in a 31-10 home rout of Cincinnati. Against Baltimore, the Texans couldn't hold onto the ball and quickly fell behind by two touchdowns. 
 
 Arian Foster ran for 132 yards, the first player ever to rush for 100 yards against the Ravens in the postseason. But Yates' three interceptions matched the total he had in six regular season games. 
 
 ""I can't have the turnovers,"" Yates said. ""If we don't turn the ball over like that, we have a chance to win. And we still had a chance to win. If I'd done a better job of protecting the football, I really think we'd have come out with the win today. We did a good job of moving the ball and we had some big plays, but you can't have that many picks."" 
 
 Yates was the third starting quarterback used by Houston this season following injuries to Matt Schaub and Matt Leinart. The Texans also lost wide receiver Andre Johnson for a spell and finished without sack specialist Mario Williams, who missed the last two-thirds of the season. 
 
 And still, the Texans got within a win of reaching the conference title game. After the game, team owner Bob McNair pulled aside coach Gary Kubiak and congratulated him. 
 
 ""I told him how proud I was. ... To come out and play the way this team has played, I think it's just remarkable,"" McNair said. ""Where would New England have been if (Tom) Brady wasn't playing, and if Wes Welker wasn't playing, and if their best defensive player wasn't playing? Go down the list of any of these teams and ask where they would be _ and they wouldn't be in the playoffs. And this team was in the playoffs."" 
 
 Down 17-13 at halftime, Houston twice held the Ravens without a first down in the third quarter before driving to the Baltimore 32. From there, Neil Rackers' 50-yard field goal try hit the crossbar and dropped into the end zone. 
 
 Baltimore then launched a drive in which seldom-used Lee Evans made a sensational one-handed catch for a 30-yard gain on third-and-5 from the Houston 39. On fourth-and-goal inside the 1, Ray Rice was stuffed by linebacker Tim Dobbins for no gain. 
 
 ""That's a huge play,"" Houston defensive end J.J. Watt said. ""Those are the type of plays that win playoffs games. Obviously, we wish it had gone the other way, but those are the type of plays that you remember."" 
 
 The Texans couldn't move the ball, and the Ravens took the ensuing punt at the Houston 49. But three plays netted only 4 yards, and Sam Koch punted for the seventh time. 
 
 Minutes later, the Ravens went three and out for the fourth time in five second-half possessions. Fortunately for Baltimore, the defense compensated for the team's inability to add to its early lead. 
 
 ""You have to do whatever you have to do to win a football game,"" Ravens coach John Harbaugh said. 
 
 Webb's second interception came with 7 1/2 minutes left and the Ravens clinging to 17-13 advantage. Baltimore moved 45 yards to get a field goal by Billy Cundiff with 2:52 left. 
 
 Houston's Danieal Manning muffled the record crowd of 71,547 by taking the opening kickoff 60 yards to the Baltimore 41. Yates then completed two straight passes, and after the Ravens stuffed Foster on a third-and-1, Rackers kicked a 40-yard field goal. 
 
 Baltimore failed to get a first down on its first possession and had to punt. Jacoby Jones inexplicably attempted to field the bouncing ball at the 13-yard line, was immediately hit by Cary Williams and lost the ball, which was recovered by Baltimore rookie Jimmy Smith at the 2. 
 
 On third down, Joe Flacco threw a 1-yard touchdown pass to Kris Wilson _ the tight end's first catch of the season. 
 
 After a Houston punt, Flacco completed a 21-yard pass to Anquan Boldin to set up a 48-yard field goal for a 10-3 lead. 
 
 Later in the first quarter, Ravens cornerback Lardarius Webb stepped in front of Johnson for an interception at the Houston 35. Five plays later, Flacco tossed a 10-yard touchdown pass to Boldin in the right side of the end zone. 
 
 Yates then completed a pair of third-down passes in a 59-yard drive that ended with a field goal. 
 
 After Yates misfired on third down from the Baltimore 10, the rookie came off the field he was greeted by coach Gary Kubiak, who put a hand on the back of the quarterback's jersey while chatting. 
 
 Yates returned after a Baltimore punt to direct a 12-play, 86-yard drive that ended with a 1-yard touchdown run by Foster, who accounted for 66 yards _ including 54 on the ground. 
 
 Yates went 17 for 35 for 184 yards. Johnson had eight catches for 111 yards. 
 
 Notes: Baltimore improved to 6-0 against Houston, 2-0 this season. ... It was the Ravens' first home playoff win since 2000. ... Foster ran for 285 yards in the postseason, most by a player in his first two NFL playoff games. ... With the Ravens' home win, it's the first time since the NFL went to current playoff format in 1990 that the first seven games have been won by the home team.","– For Eli Manning and the New York Giants, Lambeau Field has become a familiar launching pad. After beating the Green Bay Packers at home for the second time in four years, they only hope this trip ends the same way—at the Super Bowl. Manning threw three touchdown passes and the Giants shocked the Packers 37-20 in an NFC divisional playoff game today. Manning threw for 330 yards, sending the Giants to San Francisco for the NFC championship game next Sunday night. More from today's football games: The San Francisco 49ers beat the New Orleans Saints in a thrilling 36-32 game today. With New Orleans poised to score on its opening possession, Donte Whitner delivered a crushing blow that knocked out running back Pierre Thomas and forced the first of five Saints turnovers. San Francisco's hard-hitting, opportunistic defense set the tone the same way it has all season, putting the 49ers back in the NFC championship for the first time since the 1997 season. If style points and offensive fireworks meant anything, the Baltimore Ravens wouldn't stand a chance of making it to the AFC championship. Playing defense and protecting the football are what they do best, and that formula led to a 20-13 victory over the Houston Texans today, putting Baltimore in the AFC title game against the New England Patriots next Sunday, with the winner advancing to the Super Bowl in Indianapolis on Feb. 5.","['With New Orleans poised to score on its opening possession, Donte Whitner delivered a crushing blow that knocked out running back Pierre Thomas and forced the first of five Saints turnovers. \n \n New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees (9) hits the ground in front of San Francisco 49ers defensive tackle Ricky Jean-Francois (95) during the second quarter of an NFL divisional playoff football...

(Associated Press) \n \n San Francisco\'s hard-hitting, opportunistic defense set the tone in the 49ers\' thrilling 36-32 playoff win the same way it has all season. \n \n From Justin Smith and Aldon Smith harassing Drew Brees all day, to Patrick Willis and NaVorro Bowman shutting down the running game and Dashon Goldson making punishing hits and key plays from the secondary, the defense is the biggest reason for the resurgence in San Francisco that has the 49ers (14-3) back in the NFC championship for the first time since the 1997 season. \n \n They will play the Giants next Sunday at Candlestick Park after New York defeated the defending Super Bowl champion Green Bay Packers 37-20 on Sunday. San Francisco beat Eli Manning and the Giants 27-20 at home Nov. 13. \n \n ""It\'s a lot better than traveling to Wisconsin. More importantly, we\'re playing a team we\'ve already faced,"" cornerback Carlos Rogers said Sunday. ""It\'s not as hard as preparing for another team we haven\'t faced yet."" \n \n ""Home game huh?"" Whitner tweeted Sunday once his opponent had been determined. \n \n An offensive show featuring four lead changes defined the final five minutes of the Niners\' win Saturday, capped by Alex Smith\'s 14-yard touchdown pass to Vernon Davis with 9 seconds remaining. But Whitner got things going in the franchise\'s first postseason appearance in nine years. \n \n ""It let the (Saints) offense know we were going to be physical all day,"" Whitner said of the hit on Thomas, who left with a head injury and never returned. \n \n Whitner was unfazed by his pass interference penalty moments earlier that briefly sent shaken-up tight end Jimmy Graham to the sideline. Whitner\'s jarring, legal helmet-to-helmet hit on Thomas was a blow to the Saints\' psyche as well as to their depth chart. \n \n The 49ers defense has been so stingy this season they didn\'t allow a 100-yard runner or a rushing touchdown until the second-to-last game of the year Dec. 24 at Seattle. Hall of Famer Ronnie Lott, part of plenty of top-notch defenses himself, has praised these men for not ""giving up inches."" \n \n ""We\'ve got a great defense. We feel like we can stop anyone,"" Bowman said. ""When it\'s not working for our offense, it\'s our job to get the ball back for them as many times as we can. That\'s all it was. If those guys aren\'t doing well it\'s our job to pick it up. That\'s what a team is and I think we have a great one here."" \n \n First-year coach Jim Harbaugh brought defensive coordinator Vic Fangio along with him from Stanford when he was hired last January _ and Fangio has developed his unit into one of the NFL\'s best. \n \n ""We like to think that we play defense the right way,"" Fangio said. ""We play physical, we play with our hands. We run to the ball. We don\'t try and do anything too fancy, although we do have our changeups here and there. We try and play defense the old-fashioned, hard school way."" \n \n The Niners had 38 takeaways during the regular season to only 10 turnovers. Their plus-28 turnover differential matched the 2010 Patriots for the second-best mark in NFL history since 1941. \n \n They forced five more Saturday, and only had one turnover themselves. \n \n San Francisco\'s determined defenders heard all week how difficult it would be to stop Brees and Co., knowing many figured they\'d fail. \n \n ""We got tired of it throughout the week. They gave us no chance,"" Goldson said. ""They kept talking about the Saints, the Saints, where they stand against us and what they were going to do. We ignored everything and focused on us and what we had to do to come win this game."" \n \n Goldson had six interceptions for the NFC West champions during the regular season, then his biggest yet Saturday. That first-quarter pick snapped Brees\' NFL-record streak of 226 postseason passes without an interception dating to the NFC championship game against Chicago five years ago. \n \n Tarell Brown had the other interception, while special teams standouts Blake Costanzo and Madieu Williams each forced a fumble. \n \n ""Our guys were humming. We were able to pry a couple out and that was big,"" Fangio said. ""The interceptions were big also."" \n \n The Niners were No. 1 in the NFL in stopping the run during the season and didn\'t allow a rushing TD on Saturday after the Saints scored three on the ground in a 45-28 win over the Detroit Lions in the Superdome in last weekend\'s wild-card round. \n \n The Saints produced a playoff-record 626 yards against the Lions, with Brees throwing for 466 yards while completing 33 of 43 passes. \n \n ""I had figured coming into this game they would feel like, `Let\'s keep everything in front of us, let\'s not give up big plays and obviously do a good job against the rush and try to put them in third-and-long situations,\'"" Brees said. ""They did, yet again, a great job stopping the run in a lot of cases which we felt like in order to really get chunks, we would have to throw it. Obviously that\'s a great defense. It\'s one of the best defenses in the league."" \n \n Goldson was re-signed to a one-year contract as a free agent in August to complement newcomers and fellow defensive backs Whitner and Carlos Rogers. Against the Saints, Goldson had a team-leading 11 tackles to go with the first-quarter interception and two passes defensed. Bowman also made 11 tackles, 10 of those solo. \n \n ""We got some spectacular stops,"" Harbaugh said. ""On third down, I thought they were outstanding. Five takeaways in the game. I know the special teams contributed to that as well. Very opportunistic today. Got pressure on their quarterback. Made plays on the ball, and made them when they were there to be made. Our guys in the secondary made them. It was a terrific job by our defense, once again. You just love the way they play. You love the way they compete. Love how hard they work on the field."" \n \n The 49ers sacked the record-setting Brees three times, including rookie Aldon Smith\'s pounding for an 11-yard loss on third down in the first quarter. All-Pro defensive tackle Justin Smith brought Brees to the ground for a 9-yard loss in the third quarter and Ahmad Brooks added a fourth-quarter sack on which Brees lost 7 yards. \n \n ""We wanted to come out and play our style of football, which is playing physical, being a great tackling team, and playing with good fundamentals which has carried us all year,"" Fangio said. ""We just wanted to play the way we\'ve played all year, particularly starting early in the game."" \n \n Whitner definitely did his part. \n \n ""I told myself that I was going to hit anything moving today and that I was going to be extremely physical, even if I hit my own guys,"" he said. ""Luckily, I didn\'t hit too many of my own guys.""

 BLACK BEAR RANCH, Calif. — For more than 10 days, a remote California commune unknowingly played host to a Tennessee teen and the man accused of abducting her. 
 
 Now the 40 or so members of the Black Bear Ranch intentional community in Siskiyou County are reeling from the deception and looking at ways to prevent repeat incidents, spokeswoman Karuna Greenberg said in a statement. 
 
 Missing teen Elizabeth Thomas, 15, of Culleoka, Tenn., and her one-time health science teacher, Tad Cummins, 50, of Columbia, Tenn., showed up unexpectedly April 6 calling themselves Joanna and John, ages 22 and 44. Greenberg said the ranch welcomed the couple though unexpected visitors are discouraged. 
 
 ""While at the ranch they spun a convincing story that we now know to be false,"" Greenburg said. 
 
 ► Tuesday: Recently found teen's father files for divorce, seeks restraining order 
 
 ► Monday: Teacher accused of abducting student was going to Mexico, records show 
 
 The ranch has no newspaper delivery nor Internet service, so residents didn't know about the manhunt for Cummins nor the Amber alert issued March 13 for Elizabeth, the ranch spokeswoman said. The two disappeared as the Maury County school board were conducting an investigation into their relationship after a student spotted the two kissing at Culleoka Unit School, about 10 miles southeast of Columbia. 
 
 By April 17, ""these two visitors were told they were not a fit with the ranch and were asked to leave,"" Greenburg said.

 Siskiyou County sheriff's deputies found Cummins and Elizabeth three days later after a tip from Cecilville, Calif. The caretaker of a remote cabin and his neighbor thought Cummins, who said he lost everything in a fire in Colorado and needed a place to stay, was acting a bit strange, so they told the sheriff; they had seen an article on the Internet about the search. 
 
 
 
 Cecilville is less than 10 miles southeast of the ranch as the crow files, but the mountain roads are so winding that it would take more than an hour to get to the community, which has fewer than two dozen residents. Black Bear Ranch is also less than 10 miles east of Forks of Salmon, Calif., its official mailing address and nearest post office, but residents need more than an hour to get to that town of fewer than 200 people. 
 
 
 
 Tad Cummins, 50, of Columbia, Tenn., was arrested April 20, 2017, in Siskiyou County, Calif., after more than a monthlong manhunt and charged with transportation of a minor across state lines for the purpose of criminal sexual intercourse, a federal crime. (Photo: Siskiyou County (Calif.) Sheriff's Office) 
 
 Cellphone service at both the ranch and the remote cabin where Cummins and Elizabeth were found is spotty at best and generally nonexistent, authorities say. 
 
 ""We were shocked to learn they were actually a fugitive teacher from Tennessee and his allegedly captive student, on the run from law enforcement,"" Greenberg said. ""We are extremely glad that Cummins was caught, and hope that Elizabeth Thomas can begin to heal from this terrible incident."" 
 
 Black Bear Ranch is evaluating its open-door policy and has decided to stop accepting visitors until it makes a thorough review of its practices, Greenburg said. 
 
 ""Black Bear is committed to equality, safety, and nonviolence,"" Greenberg said. ""We stand firmly and explicitly against all forms of exploitation. We do not harbor fugitives, runaways or known criminals."" 
 
 The commune was established in 1968 when Richard Marley came from San Francisco with 30 friends and converted a former gold mine into an off-the-grid community. 
 
 Investigators have not said how Cummins came to know about Black Bear Ranch, but another longtime commune called The Farm is located less than 30 miles from Columbia near Summertown, Tenn. It was established in 1971.

 Now, as the 15-year-old receives counseling and Cummins, 50, sits in jail awaiting extradition, details are emerging on her experience when she was missing for 38 days. 
 
 Elizabeth and Cummins were allegedly in Northern California for a week and a half, authorities believe, spending a few days and nights in Berkley and Black Bear Ranch Commune before ending up in a cabin in rural Cecilville, more than 2,000 miles from Tennessee. 
 
 Family attorney Jason Whatley says the cabin could be described as a four-walled shelter without running water or electricity or heat piping. Elizabeth and Cummins at times ate wildflowers to survive, which led to Elizabeth losing a significant amount of weight. 
 
 Among some personal possessions found in the cabin were toilet paper, food items and a beer bottle, Siskiyou County Sheriff Jon Lopey previously told PEOPLE. 
 
 The lack of food showed, Whatley says. When he met Elizabeth last week, she was physically and emotionally “fragile.” 
 
 “I was so shocked when I saw her first,” Whatley says. “I didn’t know it but she was even smaller than she was used to be being. She [had] lost a lot [of weight].” 
 
 Whatley also says the teen also appeared to not have shower or bathed the entire time she was gone, asking to take a shower as soon as she was rescued.

 Griffin Barry, the caretaker of the cabin who called authorities when he recognized the pair from the ongoing AMBER Alert they were the subject of, says he gave the couple food in exchange for manual labor around the property. 
 
 According to Barry, Cummins passed himself and Elizabeth off as a couple named “John” and “Joanna” and said Elizabeth was 24. Whatley says Cummins would do most of the talking, with Elizabeth whispering in his ear. Barry tells PEOPLE he only heard Elizabeth speak once. 
 
 “One time I had given him food that night and [she] was like, ‘Thank you,’ ” Barry recalls about giving Elizabeth rice and clementines. “She got excited over some food.” 
 
 Clothing-Optional Commune and ‘Damaging’ Treatment 
 
 Whatley says that Cummins “treated her like a child at times. I think most people would agree that the combination of treating her like a child and an adult woman in the same relationship, like a light switched [and] turned it on and off, [is] damaging.” 
 
 Before settling at the remote cabin Whatley say Cummins brought Elizabeth to Black Bear Ranch, a clothing-optional commune. Whatley says Elizabeth was for a few days was in the presence of nude men before they pair headed to Cecilville, where they met Barry. 
 
 According to the commune’s website, Elizabeth and Cummins were “asked to leave” by residents after a few days. 
 
 “Residents had no access to national news and had no idea who this couple was, [their] ages or their history in relation to the charges that have now surfaced,” a statement reads. 
 
 The statement adds that the commune “does not condone the acts that Tad Cummins has been charged with.”

 Whatley says when she reunited with her family, Elizabeth was “quiet,” but he says it was obvious the weeks allegedly with Cummins had taken an emotional toll. 
 
 “She’s had moments of being carefree and fun, but [at the same time] she’s very, very fragile and that’s something the family is watching very carefully.” 
 
 On Monday, Cummins’ public defender, Benjamin Galloway, issued a statement defending his client, claiming he has “no history of violence and no criminal history whatsoever,” and that he didn’t coerce, force or threaten Elizabeth, Cummins’ former student at the Culleoka Unit School in Maury County, Tennessee. 
 
 Cummins — who authorities said faces kidnapping and sex crime charges in California and Tennessee as well as a federal charge — “surrendered without incident and has been cooperative with investigators,” Galloway said. “He looks forward to returning to Tennessee as soon as possible to answer the charges against him.” 
 
 Whatley says any suggestion that Elizabeth might have gone willingly is “amazingly absurd.” 
 
 “This is classic grooming and manipulation,” he adds. “And I predict this case will be studied years in the future about how authority figures like Tad Cummins can mess up young children who believe their lies and are manipulated into doing things they would never do.” 
 
 Cummins appeared in federal court in Sacramento, California, on Monday afternoon. He faces one federal count of transporting a minor with the intent to engage in sexual activity across state lines. 
 
 He has not entered a plea and was detained as a flight risk. 
 
 He will be transported to Tennessee “as soon as possible,” a U.S. Attorney’s Office spokeswoman said.","– One thing seems to have overshadowed Elizabeth Thomas' 38 days spent with her former teacher: hunger. The 15-year-old had resorted to eating wildflowers at times and had lost a significant amount of weight, the family lawyer tells People. ""I was so shocked when I saw her,"" says Jason Whatley, who added that she appeared unshowered as well. The caretaker of the remote cabin in Cecilville, California, where she and Tad Cummins were found by police said the single time he heard the teen talk was when she thanked him for rice and clementines he brought the pair in exchange for manual labor. “She got excited over some food,"" he said. Police say Cummins, who awaits extradition to Tennessee on kidnapping charges, and Thomas spent 10 days at a nearby remote commune prior to moving into the cabin, which had no electricity or running water. Officials at the commune, Black Bear Ranch, say they're appalled they were duped by Cummins' lies but say they have no access to the internet or newspapers and had seen no stories about the missing teen, reports the Redding Record Searchlight. At any rate, after 10 days, ""these two visitors were told they were not a fit with the ranch and were asked to leave,"" says a spokesperson. The commune is re-evaluating its open-door policy in the wake of the incident. Whatley tells People Elizabeth was exposed to nude men at the clothing-optional commune.

Greenberg said the ranch welcomed the couple though unexpected visitors are discouraged. \n \n ""While at the ranch they spun a convincing story that we now know to be false,"" Greenburg said. \n \n ► Tuesday: Recently found teen\'s father files for divorce, seeks restraining order \n \n ► Monday: Teacher accused of abducting student was going to Mexico, records show \n \n The ranch has no newspaper delivery nor Internet service, so residents didn\'t know about the manhunt for Cummins nor the Amber alert issued March 13 for Elizabeth, the ranch spokeswoman said. The two disappeared as the Maury County school board were conducting an investigation into their relationship after a student spotted the two kissing at Culleoka Unit School, about 10 miles southeast of Columbia. \n \n By April 17, ""these two visitors were told they were not a fit with the ranch and were asked to leave,"" Greenburg said. \n \n Elizabeth Thomas, 15, of Culleoka, Tenn., was found almost 2,000 miles from home April 20, 2017, after leaving with her 50-year-old teacher more than a month before.

The caretaker of a remote cabin and his neighbor thought Cummins, who said he lost everything in a fire in Colorado and needed a place to stay, was acting a bit strange, so they told the sheriff; they had seen an article on the Internet about the search. \n \n \n \n Cecilville is less than 10 miles southeast of the ranch as the crow files, but the mountain roads are so winding that it would take more than an hour to get to the community, which has fewer than two dozen residents. Black Bear Ranch is also less than 10 miles east of Forks of Salmon, Calif., its official mailing address and nearest post office, but residents need more than an hour to get to that town of fewer than 200 people. \n \n \n \n Tad Cummins, 50, of Columbia, Tenn., was arrested April 20, 2017, in Siskiyou County, Calif., after more than a monthlong manhunt and charged with transportation of a minor across state lines for the purpose of criminal sexual intercourse, a federal crime. (Photo: Siskiyou County (Calif.) Sheriff\'s Office) \n \n Cellphone service at both the ranch and the remote cabin where Cummins and Elizabeth were found is spotty at best and generally nonexistent, authorities say. \n \n ""We were shocked to learn they were actually a fugitive teacher from Tennessee and his allegedly captive student, on the run from law enforcement,"" Greenberg said. ""We are extremely glad that Cummins was caught, and hope that Elizabeth Thomas can begin to heal from this terrible incident."" \n \n Black Bear Ranch is evaluating its open-door policy and has decided to stop accepting visitors until it makes a thorough review of its practices, Greenburg said. \n \n ""Black Bear is committed to equality, safety, and nonviolence,"" Greenberg said. ""We stand firmly and explicitly against all forms of exploitation. We do not harbor fugitives, runaways or known criminals."" \n \n The commune was established in 1968 when Richard Marley came from San Francisco with 30 friends and converted a former gold mine into an off-the-grid community. \n \n Investigators have not said how Cummins came to know about Black Bear Ranch, but another longtime commune called The Farm is located less than 30 miles from Columbia near Summertown, Tenn.

"Donald Trump's presidential campaign is planning on a political convention packed with sports stars. 
 
 “It’s gonna be a great combination of our great politicians,"" said Ivanka Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee's daughter, during a Wednesday radio interview, according to Buzzfeed, ""but also great American businessmen and women and leaders across industry and leaders across really all the sectors, from athletes to coaches and everything in between.” 
 
 She added that the July 18-21 convention in Cleveland was ""not gonna be a ho-hum lineup of the typical politicians.” 
 
 However, the campaign's efforts to secure the attendance of some of their top choices in the sports world have been rocky. 
 
 People familiar with the planning of the convention told Bloomberg Politics on Tuesday that campaign aides were lining up several retired athletes, coaches and other sports leaders to appear at the convention. On Wednesday, former undisputed world heavyweight champion Mike Tyson and NASCAR CEO Brian France, two of those on the list, both announced through spokespeople that they would not attend. Former Chicago Bears coach Mike Ditka, another sports legend organizers listed, said he was willing to appear but had not been asked to do so. 
 
 The list of athletes outlined by those familiar with the planning also included Bobby Knight, the former Indiana University basketball coach who Trump frequently credits for his Indiana primary victory.

 “Mike Tyson endorsed me, I love it,” Trump said in April in Indiana. “You know, all the tough guys endorse me. I like that.” 
 
 Following the Indiana rally, Trump was criticized for touting the endorsement of Tyson, who had served three years in prison after being convicted in the state for raping a beauty pageant contestant. 
 
 Tyson and France have publicly backed Trump, and Ditka has voiced strong support for the presumptive Republican nominee. 
 
 On Wednesday, Ditka told the Chicago Tribune that he was ""happy to do it"" but was unaware of any talks to appear at the convention. A NASCAR spokesperson speaking on behalf of France said Wednesday that he ""does not plan to speak at nor attend the convention,"" according to Motorsports.com. 
 
 Trump has said on the campaign trail that he wants the event to be a gathering of “winners”—and not politicians, like at past conventions. “We’re going to do it a little different, if that’s OK,” he said in Virginia earlier this month. “I’m thinking about getting some of the great sports people who like me a lot.”

"BEIJING (Reuters) - China has retrieved 8.5 tonnes of waste from Mount Everest since April as it clears garbage left by growing numbers of visitors, the state-run Global Times said on Thursday. 
 
 Enthusiasts from all over the world who flock to the world’s tallest mountain, at a height of 8,850 meters (29,035 ft) between Tibet and Nepal, discard tonnes of trash each year. 
 
 A team of 30 people has cleared about 5.2 tonnes of household waste, 2.3 tonnes of human faeces, and one tonne of mountaineering trash in the cleanup by Tibetan mountaineering officials, the paper said. 
 
 The work is almost as demanding as tackling the summit, say climbers, since collection is a strenuous task that boosts the consumption of oxygen people need to breathe, it added. 
 
 During last year’s climbing season, which usually runs from March until May, 202 climbers summitted from the Tibetan side, versus 446 from the Nepali side, while thousands of tourists visited base camps on both sides. 
 
 The warming global climate has melted frozen garbage left by climbers over decades, spurring environmental concern in Nepal, India and China, which is taking tough measures to clean up air, water and soil contaminated after decades of breakneck growth. 
 
 Since 2015, officials in Tibet have given every climber two trash bags to retrieve at least 8 kg of rubbish, levying a fine of $100 for each kilogram by which a climber falls short. Nepal adopted similar rules in 2014. 
 
 China also plans to build environmentally friendly toilet and waste collection sites at Mount Everest, the official Xinhua news agency said. 
 
 Authorities in Tibet have pledged to complete 45 pollution cleanup tasks before 2020, according to a list published this week by the environment ministry, after a central inspection team flagged concerns last year. 
 
 Beijing plans a further round of inspections early next year, the People’s Daily newspaper of the ruling Communist Party has said. ||||| Veteran Climber Kami Rita Sherpa, center left, receives an honorary certificate during a function organized to mark Everest Day in Kathmandu, Nepal, Tuesday, May 29, 2018.

Nepal has honored several Sherpa guides for their own Everest successes on the anniversary of the first conquest of the world's... (Associated Press) 
 
 KATHMANDU, Nepal (AP) — Nepal honored several Sherpa guides for their Everest successes on the anniversary Tuesday of the first conquest of the world's highest peak. 
 
 Government minister Bina Magar, herself an Everest climber, honored the guides at a ceremony held every year on the date in 1953 that New Zealander Edmund Hillary and his guide Tenzing Norgay first set foot on the summit of the 8,850-meter (29,035-foot) mountain. 
 
 Those honored included Kami Rita, who just climbed the mountain for a record 22nd time. He said last week when he returned from the mountain that he plans to guide climbers to the summit next year as well. He first scaled Everest at age 24 and has made the climb almost every year since then. 
 
 The ceremony also honored Lhakpa Sherpa, 44, whose nine climbs are the most for a woman. She lives in West Hartford, Connecticut, for much of the year and works at a grocery store when she's not guiding foreign climbers. She and her brother guided some 50 climbers on Everest earlier this month. 
 
 The ceremony also honored seven brothers who all have made it to the top of Everest and have combined for 61 total ascents. 
 
 A certificate issued by Guinness World Records was handed over to the brothers at the ceremony in Kathmandu. 
 
 Since Mount Everest was first conquered, thousands of climbers have reached the summit, while more than 300 have lost their lives on the unpredictable slopes. 
 
 An avalanche struck just above base camp in 2014, killing 16 Sherpa guides, while a year later another avalanche triggered by an earthquake ripped through base camp, killing 19 people.","– The world's tallest mountain is covered in a whole heap of trash. That's why a Chinese team of 30 people has been tasked with hauling decades worth of climbers' garbage off Mt. Everest. Since April, they've managed to bring down over 9 tons of cast-off mountaineering gear and other garbage, the Reuters reports, citing the state-run Global Times. However, lost carabiners and old tents don't make up all the junk. Human waste and household waste made up over two tons and five tons of the removed mass respectively. Since the task is an extremely arduous one, officials in Tibet have given every climber since 2015 on Tibet's side of the 29,000 foot peak two trash bags to use to bring back down at least 8 kilos of trash, or over 17.5 pounds. A climber is fined if they come up short. Scientists say climate change is warming things up on Everest, causing snow to melt and accumulated trash to emerge. At the same time, more brave climbers than ever are ascending the mountain. Per Reuters, last years climbing season saw 202 summit from the Tibet side and 446 via Nepal's slope. Thousands of others visited camps along both mountainsides. According to the AP, the spring season runs just March until the end of May, after which weather conditions on the mountain begin to deteriorate. There are only about a couple of days of windows of good weather on the highest part of the peak in May, when climbers rush to attempt their way to the summit. (Among this year's climbers to reach the top was double amputee Xia Boyu.)","['BEIJING (Reuters) - China has retrieved 8.5 tonnes of waste from Mount Everest since April as it clears garbage left by growing numbers of visitors, the state-run Global Times said on Thursday. \n \n Enthusiasts from all over the world who flock to the world’s tallest mountain, at a height of 8,850 meters (29,035 ft) between Tibet and Nepal, discard tonnes of trash each year. \n \n A team of 30 people has cleared about 5.2 tonnes of household waste, 2.3 tonnes of human faeces, and one tonne of mountaineering trash in the cleanup by Tibetan mountaineering officials, the paper said. \n \n The work is almost as demanding as tackling the summit, say climbers, since collection is a strenuous task that boosts the consumption of oxygen people need to breathe, it added. \n \n During last year’s climbing season, which usually runs from March until May, 202 climbers summitted from the Tibetan side, versus 446 from the Nepali side, while thousands of tourists visited base camps on both sides. \n \n The warming global climate has melted frozen garbage left by climbers over decades, spurring environmental concern in Nepal, India and China, which is taking tough measures to clean up air, water and soil contaminated after decades of breakneck growth. \n \n Since 2015, officials in Tibet have given every climber two trash bags to retrieve at least 8 kg of rubbish, levying a fine of $100 for each kilogram by which a climber falls short. Nepal adopted similar rules in 2014. \n \n China also plans to build environmentally friendly toilet and waste collection sites at Mount Everest, the official Xinhua news agency said. \n \n Authorities in Tibet have pledged to complete 45 pollution cleanup tasks before 2020, according to a list published this week by the environment ministry, after a central inspection team flagged concerns last year. \n \n Beijing plans a further round of inspections early next year, the People’s Daily newspaper of the ruling Communist Party has said.

(Associated Press) \n \n KATHMANDU, Nepal (AP) — Nepal honored several Sherpa guides for their Everest successes on the anniversary Tuesday of the first conquest of the world's highest peak. \n \n Government minister Bina Magar, herself an Everest climber, honored the guides at a ceremony held every year on the date in 1953 that New Zealander Edmund Hillary and his guide Tenzing Norgay first set foot on the summit of the 8,850-meter (29,035-foot) mountain. \n \n Those honored included Kami Rita, who just climbed the mountain for a record 22nd time. He said last week when he returned from the mountain that he plans to guide climbers to the summit next year as well. He first scaled Everest at age 24 and has made the climb almost every year since then. \n \n The ceremony also honored Lhakpa Sherpa, 44, whose nine climbs are the most for a woman. She lives in West Hartford, Connecticut, for much of the year and works at a grocery store when she's not guiding foreign climbers. She and her brother guided some 50 climbers on Everest earlier this month. \n \n The ceremony also honored seven brothers who all have made it to the top of Everest and have combined for 61 total ascents. \n \n A certificate issued by Guinness World Records was handed over to the brothers at the ceremony in Kathmandu. \n \n Since Mount Everest was first conquered, thousands of climbers have reached the summit, while more than 300 have lost their lives on the unpredictable slopes. \n \n An avalanche struck just above base camp in 2014, killing 16 Sherpa guides, while a year later another avalanche triggered by an earthquake ripped through base camp, killing 19 people.""]",2
"Last week, 18 sex offenders in Bradford County, Florida, found large red signs outside their homes that read, ""a convicted sexual predator... lives at this location."" The Bradford County Police Department installed the signs. 
 
 I spoke with Brad Smith, the department's Chief of Operations (pictured above left, looking least smug), to see what this new method of community notification was all about. 
 
 VICE: What's with the signs, Brad? 
 
 Captain Brad Smith: Florida statutes say that we must notify the public of any sex offenders in our jurisdiction. We already do that with Facebook and by going out into the area to notify people when the person first moves in, but we realized there was a possible issue with continued notification. For instance, if somebody moves in after we've gone around notifying people, then they're not aware that there's a predator there. We're just trying to do everything we can to make the public aware. And, in a certain sense, it protects the predator from having people, especially children, approaching their residence without being duly notified. 
 
 OK... So it's just sexual predators with child victims? Or is it all sexual predators? 
 
 It could be somebody who raped an adult or a child. In the state of Florida being a sex offender and a sexual predator are different things. A sexual predator is somebody who's been convicted of a first-degree felony that's sexual in nature or multiple second-degree felonies that are sexual in nature. 
 
 Right. Any plans to extend this to other crimes? Like murderers or serial scam artists or whatever? 
 
 Only if the Florida statutes said that we had to. At this point in time, the only statute that's directing the sheriff to do anything is with sexual predators. 
 
 I know this information is available online already, but do you think the signs will invite people to harass the people at these addresses? 
 
 No. We don't expect that to happen, and if it does, we will do everything in our power to protect the person's rights. But I don't believe this will entice anybody to approach the houses. 
 
 Are you not worried that these people will sue? This seems like something that goes beyond the statutory directive for notification. 
 
 Well, you know as well as I do that people can sue anybody for anything these days. We're certain challenges wouldn't stand up in court though, because we're being directed by a Florida statute, and the statute specifically says, ""the sheriff of the county or the police chief of the municipality where the sexual predator resides shall notify the community and the public of the presence of the sexual predator in a manner that is deemed appropriate by the sheriff or the chief of police."" 
 
 Do you predict a rise in the number of trick-or-treaters these guys will get on Halloween? I feel you guys are really raising the bar in terms of ""that creepy house in the neighborhood that all the kids dare each other to go to on Halloween."" 
 
 No... As a matter of fact, for the past several years, we've gone out to the residences that these people are registered at and notified them that they need to make sure that they do everything possible not to entice any kids to their houses. Like, don't have candy to give out, don't have their porch lights on, and don't answer the door if kids do come knocking. 
 
 But when you were a kid, wouldn't you have totally gone to a house with one of those signs and all the lights off? 
 
 I didn't even like going to the scary movies when I was a kid, let alone going to scary houses. Nobody had to tell me that I had to be careful. And in this day and age, kids are much smarter and heed warnings better than I did when I was growing up. 
 
 Right. OK, thanks Brad. 
 
 @JLCT ||||| If you've driven on Highway 301 in Starke, you may notice a red sign in front of one home. The sign was put up by the Bradford County Sheriff's Office, but it's drawing attention because it says a sexual predator lives there. 
 
 Andrew Thomas Jr. lives right behind the home that now has a red sign indicating a sexual predator. 
 
 
 
 ""It just astounded me really. It's like twenty feet behind our house. That's just scary. Dude could be like watching out his back window looking at us,"" said Thomas Jr. 
 
 Thomas Jr. lives with his family and girlfriend and just moved in three months ago. He never thought he would live right behind a registered sexual predator. He says he's mostly concerned because he has younger siblings. 
 
 ""They're right behind our house and my little brother, he goes outside all day, plays outside all day and a little sister that comes to the bus stop,"" said Thomas Jr. 
 
 The red sign is just the first of more than a dozen that the Bradford County Sheriff's Office will put up at sexual predators' homes across the county in an effort to inform people living in the area. 
 
 ""This is all about keeping our community safe and to make sure we don't have one more victim of a sexual crime in my community as long as I'm the sheriff,"" said Sheriff Gordon Smith with the Bradford Co. Sheriff's Office. 
 
 The signs are legal under Florida Statute 775.21 that says law enforcement agencies can ""inform the community and the public of the presence of a sexual predator."" 
 
 GTN News did try to talk with Sean Starling but he didn't want to go on camera. Still neighbors like Andrew Jr. have concerns. 
 
 ""Just the thought of that of them being outside and he could be watching or, you know, just come by and just wipe them up. I mean, any of that."" 
 
 
 
 The Sheriff's Office tells GTN News the rest of the red signs should be up by the end of the week.

","– Police in Bradford County, Florida, have taken a highly visible step in making sure no sexual predator goes unnoticed: Officials there last week erected bold red signs in front of the homes of 18 registered sexual predators. GTN News reports that the signs are permitted under a Florida statute that gives authorities the power to ""inform the community and the public of the presence"" of such an offender. They read: ""[Name] is a convicted Sexual Predator and lives at this location."" (Side note: Florida classifies sex offenders and sexual predators differently; the latter are those convicted of a single first-degree felony or multiple second-degree felonies of a sexual nature.) A captain with the county's police department explains the reasoning to Vice: Though they already post notices to Facebook and go into the community to alert residents, ""we realized there was a possible issue with continued notification. If somebody moves in after we've gone around notifying people, then they're not aware that there's a predator there."" So how are these now-informed residents reacting?

"Long lines of foreigners massed over the past couple of weeks at Tripoli International Airport looking to secure a flight out. Across town, Libya’s parliament meets in a tent. 
 
 As Libya gears up for the second anniversary of the revolution that ousted Muammar Qaddafi, the euphoria from his toppling and death after more than 40 years has given way to violence and political gridlock. 
 
 “Most people have taken the sensible decision, foreigners in particular, not to be around, it could be a celebration or a civil war,” said John Hamilton, of Cross Border Information, a U.K.-based consultancy. “It’s hard to imagine any politician from any country being able to tackle these challenges.” 
 
 The test may come today, when protests are expected in Benghazi, the birthplace of the uprising, raising the possibility of violence. Official commemorations are on Feb. 17. 
 
 The protests, in part, are against the militias and Islamists who are blamed for the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi that left the American ambassador, Chris Stevens, dead. The Islamists argue the protests are an attempt by pro-Qaddafi elements to undermine the revolution, said Firas Abi Ali, head of Middle East and North Africa Forecasting with Exclusive Analysis, a political risk consultancy. 
 
 “If fighting leads to tens or hundreds of casualties, there would be a severe risk that rival militias would attempt to seize key government buildings and infrastructure, including refineries, state energy firms’ offices and airports,” he said in an e-mailed note. 
 
 Security Boosted 
 
 The authorities have boosted security and temporarily shuttered the land borders with Egypt and Tunisia before the anniversary. Officials said 1,400 roadblocks are being set up by government security forces and allied militias. 
 
 While Prime Minister Ali Zaidan appealed last week for calm, the call has not impressed Libyans like 22-year-old Hani Al Aswad, who says the government, like its post-Qaddafi predecessor, has done nothing. 
 
 “We were all expecting so much, for it to be better, and there’s nothing,” the unemployed 22-year-old said in a recent interview in Tripoli. “Nobody gets a job, and look, there is rubbish everywhere.” 
 
 Unlike other nations that saw leaders ousted in the Arab Spring uprisings, Libya has no external financing needs because of its oil wealth. The country’s gross domestic product, which contracted 60 percent in 2011, is expected to grow by 17 percent in 2013 and average 7 percent for the period between 2014 and 2017, assuming an improvement in the domestic security situation, the International Monetary Fund said in November. 
 
 Islamist Militias 
 
 Zaidan, who assumed his post on Oct. 31, inherited a nation saddled with a dilapidated infrastructure, few functioning state institutions and an upsurge in Islamist militia activity. In addition, there are regional grievances, including unresolved demands for local autonomy in the east and south. 
 
 A declaration issued earlier this month by several political parties in Benghazi blamed the government for “leading the country into an abyss of extremism and anarchy.” Other groups and militias billed today as a “Day of Rage,” and are calling for protests. 
 
 Such warnings may have helped prompt a temporary suspension in flights to the country by Germany’s Lufthansa and Austrian Airways. Last month, the British Embassy advised its citizens to evacuate Benghazi -- a warning that came two weeks after the Italian consul-general’s car was shot at. 
 
 ‘Significant Deterrents’ 
 
 Attacks on foreign diplomats and the “enduring security concerns remain significant deterrents to foreign investment,” Torbjorn Soltvedt, senior analyst at U.K. risk consultancy Maplecroft, said in e-mailed comments. 
 
 Libya and the nations that supported the uprising against Qaddafi met on Feb. 12 in Paris, with the focus on border security. The issue gained importance after the widened conflict in Mali and the fatal attack by militants on an Algerian natural gas facility last month that left 38 foreigners dead. Algerian authorities say the attackers crossed through Libya as they made their way into the country. 
 
 The attack signaled increased risk for international oil company executives in Libya, many of whom work in desolate desert regions where security has been organized by the Libyan military and a new Oil Ministry security force. 
 
 Reviving investor confidence in Libya has also been made harder by a still-incomplete legal reform. 
 
 “To be fair, Rome wasn’t built in a day,” said John Brooke, an attorney with international law firm Clyde and Co, referring to a review of contracts by the government signed during the Qaddafi era. “The government is being sensibly cautious, but it’s reaching a stage where sensible caution is starting to look indecisive.”

 To contact the editor responsible for this story: Andrew J. Barden at barden@bloomberg.net ||||| From her perch in Tripoli fronting the Mediterranean, the naked woman and her gazelle have been silent witnesses to much of Libya’s past century: colonialism, monarchy, dictatorship and post-revolutionary unrest. 
 
 The bronze statue, with her back to the sea and an outstretched arm reaching toward the animal’s neck, is described as a symbol of unity by Libyans like Mustafa Turjman, head of research at Libya’s Antiquities Department. It’s also become a target for Islamists who have already taken aim at shrines and monuments across the country. 
 
 Saving the Tripoli landmark has become a battle in miniature for the new Libya, two years after Muammar Qaddafi was toppled from power in an uprising that left the country in the hands of a weak government and feuding militias. 
 
 “The Gazelle is something for all of Tripoli,” said Souad Wheidi, a therapist, referring the statue by its nickname. “She is part of our city’s heritage, she has survived, as have we.” 
 
 In the security vacuum that emerged since Qaddafi’s removal and killing in 2011, Islamists have flexed their muscles through attacks on foreign diplomats. They’ve also stolen the corpses of “idolatrous” Muslims and driven bulldozers through mosques and libraries. In August, acting on a tipoff, local authorities deployed police in bullet-proof vests and armed vehicles to prevent a religiously motivated attack against the bronze statue. 
 
 Protest March 
 
 Demonstrators marched around it the following day, calling for better protection for the lady and the rest of Libya’s cultural heritage. “It was a small, small, minority who were trying to break it, so we stood there against them,” said Wheidi, who helped organize the protest march. 
 
 The threats are part of the fallout from the Arab Spring uprisings that opened the door to democracy in Libya, as well as neighboring Tunisia and Egypt, where works of art have also attracted attention. 
 
 Al-Shorouk newspaper reported yesterday that the statue of the country’s greatest diva, Um Kalthoum, had been covered with a niqab, the all-encompassing veil worn by ultraconservative Muslim women, in the Egyptian city of Mansoura. 
 
 In all three North African nations, Islamists have also targeted shrines or other sites they deem offensive to Islam, sparking concerns among antiquities officials of destructive attacks on some of the world’s most valued sites. 
 
 Roman City 
 
 According to the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization, five Libyan World Heritage sites, including 12,000-year-old rock paintings in the Tadrart Acacus Mountains, the Roman city of Leptis Magna, and the Old City of Ghadames, one of the oldest pre-Saharan cities in existence, are among the sites at risk from deliberate destruction. 
 
 At least 70 Sufi sites have been attacked since Qaddafi’s death, according to leaders of the sect, which emphasizes esoteric and mystical elements of Islam using dance and prayer, and is considered idolatrous by some ultraconservative Muslims. 
 
 Islamists were driven underground by Qaddafi but have re- emerged since his downfall. The most visible sign of their strength has been in the eastern city of Benghazi, where U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens was killed in September. 
 
 The continued existence of the statue suggests Islamists in Tripoli aren’t as confident as in other parts of the country, said Shashank Joshi, associate fellow at the London-based Royal United Services Institute, in an interview. This makes the statue, installed during the Italian era of 1911-1942, something of a bellwether for militant strength. 
 
 ‘Allegorical Figure’ 
 
 “They may know they’d face a greater range of opposition if they destroyed something like that in Tripoli now, where there is more chance of retaliation than elsewhere,” he said. 
 
 “She is not intended to be seen as an object of sexual desire, but rather an as allegorical figure,” said David Rifkind, assistant professor at Florida International University, who curated an exhibition on Italian fascist art in North and East Africa last year, in an interview. 
 
 The lady represents Italy and the life-giving role of water in a desert being made fertile by aqueducts while the gazelle symbolizes Tripolitania and Cyrenaica, regions united by Italy in 1934 to form modern-day Libya, Rifkind said. 
 
 It also challenges assumptions about Tripoli, where a tacit dress code demands arms and legs are covered for modesty. 
 
 “People who live in Tripoli consider it to be very important, it’s a symbol of the city,” said Adel Turki, lecturer in Material Science at Bristol University who was born in Tripoli and helped advise on the statue’s cleaning last year. “It is part of the city, people want to protect it.” 
 
 Italian Rule 
 
 The fountain’s original name was “Sorgente di Vita,” or Source of Life, according to the dusty archives of Tripoli’s Red Castle Museum, and was made by Angiolo Vannetti. 
 
 Qaddafi spared the lady, as well as two columns on the harbor crowned by statues of Romulus and Remus, the fabled twin founders of Rome, even as he destroyed other reminders of Italian rule. In turn, artwork from Qaddafi’s four-decade rule was pulled down in the revolution. 
 
 “She survived Italians, the German army, British rule, the King and Qaddafi, just as we did,” Mohamed Bushera, a taxi driver, tells a passenger on a recent drive past the lady. “Qaddafi built almost nothing in our city in 40 years. We want more beautiful things, not less. We would be angry if the Salafists destroyed her.”

Barden at barden@bloomberg.net ', ' From her perch in Tripoli fronting the Mediterranean, the naked woman and her gazelle have been silent witnesses to much of Libya’s past century: colonialism, monarchy, dictatorship and post-revolutionary unrest. \n \n The bronze statue, with her back to the sea and an outstretched arm reaching toward the animal’s neck, is described as a symbol of unity by Libyans like Mustafa Turjman, head of research at Libya’s Antiquities Department. It’s also become a target for Islamists who have already taken aim at shrines and monuments across the country. \n \n Saving the Tripoli landmark has become a battle in miniature for the new Libya, two years after Muammar Qaddafi was toppled from power in an uprising that left the country in the hands of a weak government and feuding militias. \n \n “The Gazelle is something for all of Tripoli,” said Souad Wheidi, a therapist, referring the statue by its nickname. “She is part of our city’s heritage, she has survived, as have we.” \n \n In the security vacuum that emerged since Qaddafi’s removal and killing in 2011, Islamists have flexed their muscles through attacks on foreign diplomats. They’ve also stolen the corpses of “idolatrous” Muslims and driven bulldozers through mosques and libraries. In August, acting on a tipoff, local authorities deployed police in bullet-proof vests and armed vehicles to prevent a religiously motivated attack against the bronze statue. \n \n Protest March \n \n Demonstrators marched around it the following day, calling for better protection for the lady and the rest of Libya’s cultural heritage. “It was a small, small, minority who were trying to break it, so we stood there against them,” said Wheidi, who helped organize the protest march. \n \n The threats are part of the fallout from the Arab Spring uprisings that opened the door to democracy in Libya, as well as neighboring Tunisia and Egypt, where works of art have also attracted attention. \n \n Al-Shorouk newspaper reported yesterday that the statue of the country’s greatest diva, Um Kalthoum, had been covered with a niqab, the all-encompassing veil worn by ultraconservative Muslim women, in the Egyptian city of Mansoura. \n \n In all three North African nations, Islamists have also targeted shrines or other sites they deem offensive to Islam, sparking concerns among antiquities officials of destructive attacks on some of the world’s most valued sites. \n \n Roman City \n \n According to the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization, five Libyan World Heritage sites, including 12,000-year-old rock paintings in the Tadrart Acacus Mountains, the Roman city of Leptis Magna, and the Old City of Ghadames, one of the oldest pre-Saharan cities in existence, are among the sites at risk from deliberate destruction. \n \n At least 70 Sufi sites have been attacked since Qaddafi’s death, according to leaders of the sect, which emphasizes esoteric and mystical elements of Islam using dance and prayer, and is considered idolatrous by some ultraconservative Muslims. \n \n Islamists were driven underground by Qaddafi but have re- emerged since his downfall. The most visible sign of their strength has been in the eastern city of Benghazi, where U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens was killed in September. \n \n The continued existence of the statue suggests Islamists in Tripoli aren’t as confident as in other parts of the country, said Shashank Joshi, associate fellow at the London-based Royal United Services Institute, in an interview. This makes the statue, installed during the Italian era of 1911-1942, something of a bellwether for militant strength. \n \n ‘Allegorical Figure’ \n \n “They may know they’d face a greater range of opposition if they destroyed something like that in Tripoli now, where there is more chance of retaliation than elsewhere,” he said. \n \n “She is not intended to be seen as an object of sexual desire, but rather an as allegorical figure,” said David Rifkind, assistant professor at Florida International University, who curated an exhibition on Italian fascist art in North and East Africa last year, in an interview. \n \n The lady represents Italy and the life-giving role of water in a desert being made fertile by aqueducts while the gazelle symbolizes Tripolitania and Cyrenaica, regions united by Italy in 1934 to form modern-day Libya, Rifkind said. \n \n It also challenges assumptions about Tripoli, where a tacit dress code demands arms and legs are covered for modesty. \n \n “People who live in Tripoli consider it to be very important, it’s a symbol of the city,” said Adel Turki, lecturer in Material Science at Bristol University who was born in Tripoli and helped advise on the statue’s cleaning last year. “It is part of the city, people want to protect it.” \n \n Italian Rule \n \n The fountain’s original name was “Sorgente di Vita,” or Source of Life, according to the dusty archives of Tripoli’s Red Castle Museum, and was made by Angiolo Vannetti. \n \n Qaddafi spared the lady, as well as two columns on the harbor crowned by statues of Romulus and Remus, the fabled twin founders of Rome, even as he destroyed other reminders of Italian rule. In turn, artwork from Qaddafi’s four-decade rule was pulled down in the revolution. \n \n “She survived Italians, the German army, British rule, the King and Qaddafi, just as we did,” Mohamed Bushera, a taxi driver, tells a passenger on a recent drive past the lady. “Qaddafi built almost nothing in our city in 40 years.

"The Boston scientists found that the degree of brain changes appeared to be directly related to the amount participants smoked per week. 
 
 Young adults who occasionally smoke marijuana show abnormalities in two key areas of their brain related to emotion, motivation, and decision making, raising concerns that they could be damaging their developing minds at a critical time, according to a new study by Boston researchers. 
 
 Other studies have revealed brain changes among heavy marijuana users, but this research is believed to be the first to demonstrate such abnormalities in young, casual smokers. 
 
 The Boston scientists also found that the degree of brain changes appeared to be directly related to the amount participants smoked per week.

 Researchers did not study whether those changes were linked to corresponding declines in brain function, but lead author Jodi Gilman, a psychology instructor at Harvard Medical School and a brain scientist at Massachusetts General Hospital, said such abnormalities in young brains are reason for concern.

 “This is when you are making major decisions in your life, when you are choosing a major, starting a career, making long-lasting friendships and relationships,” Gilman said. 
 
 The findings, published Wednesday in the Journal of Neuroscience, come amid an increased debate about the long-term effects of marijuana, as a growing number of states legalize the drug for medicinal and recreational use. 
 
 Forty Boston-area young adults aged 18 to 25, many from Boston University, were selected for the study. Researchers used scans to measure the volume, shape, and density of two regions of the brain — the nucleus accumbens and the amygdala. 
 
 Half of the group said they used marijuana at least once a week, and the other 20 had not used the drug in the past year, and reported using it less than five times in their life.

 Among the group that did smoke, the median use was about six joints per week. 
 
 Scans revealed that the nucleus accumbens was larger in marijuana users, compared with nonusers, and its alteration was directly related to how much the person smoked. The nucleus accumbens is a hub in the brain that is involved with decision making and motivation. Structural changes were also seen in the amygdala, which is involved with emotional behavior. 
 
 These changes, Gilman said, may be evidence that the brain is forming new connections that encourage further drug use, “a sort of drug learning process.” The study did not address whether the brain changes are permanent. 
 
 The results are similar to animal studies that show when rats are given THC, the mind-altering ingredient in marijuana, their brains also form new connections, indicating an adaptation to the unnatural level of reward and stimulation from marijuana. 
 
 Other scientists not involved in the study say its small size makes it hard to extrapolate to the general population. But they also said the findings may help explain what happened to the brains of participants in other marijuana studies that demonstrated behavioral and functional changes, but did not use scans to identify potential brain abnormalities.

 “Anything that underscores that there may be structural changes in the brain [from marijuana use] is important,” said Dr. Staci Gruber, an associate psychiatry professor at Harvard Medical School and a director of brain imaging at McLean Hospital. 
 
 Gruber’s studies of marijuana smokers have focused on those with longer, more chronic use and have found that those who started smoking at earlier ages, while still in their teens, are less able to perform certain reasoning and decision-making tasks, compared with those who started later in life. 
 
 Stuart Gitlow, president of the American Society of Addiction Medicine, said the Mass. General study provides much-needed “hard evidence” of brain changes that appear to match the changes in cognitive skills — thinking and reasoning — that other researchers have demonstrated in marijuana studies. 
 
 “We’ve known that people who use marijuana when they’re younger tend to have cognitive abnormalities, but this gives us direct evidence,” he said. 
 
 “It’s fairly reasonable to draw the conclusion now that marijuana does alter the structure of the brain, as demonstrated in this study,” Gitlow said, “and that structural alteration is responsible, at least to some degree, for the cognitive changes we have seen in other studies.” 
 
 Earlier research has shown different brain changes linked to alcohol or other drug use, such as cocaine. 
 
 Dr. Hans Breiter, a coauthor of the Mass. General study, said there are still many unanswered questions about the potential long-term effects of these various chemicals, especially if people use more than one drug. One of his earlier studies, for instance, showed that the amygdala region of the brain shrank with cocaine use, while the new marijuana study suggests an increase. 
 
 “Most drug users use more than one drug,” said Breiter, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. 
 
 “Cocaine users use opiates, and most marijuana users also drink,” he said.

 Using marijuana a few times a week is enough to physically alter critical brain structures, according to a new study published Tuesday in The Journal of Neuroscience. 
 
 ""Just casual use appears to create changes in the brain in areas you don't want to change,"" said Hans Breiter, a psychiatrist and mathematician at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, who led the new study. 
 
 There is actually very little research on the potential benefits and downsides of casual marijuana smoking — fewer than four times a week on average. 
 
 In his study, done in collaboration with researchers at Harvard University, scientists looked at the brains of 20 relatively light marijuana users and 20 people who did not use it at all. All 40 were college students in the Boston area. 
 
 The study found volume, shape and density changes in two crucial brain areas — the nucleus accumbens and the amygdala — involved with emotion and motivation and some types of mental illness. ""This is a part of the brain you do not want to mess around with,"" Breiter said. 
 
 The more marijuana the students smoked, the more their brains differed from the non-users, the study found. 
 
 The brain continues to develop well into the 20s, and even into the 30s, said Breiter, who is concerned about the long-term impacts of marijuana use on the developing brain. 
 
 Staci Gruber, an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, who was not involved in the research, said Breiter's findings are consistent with her own, although she has focused on somewhat heavier users. 
 
 ""There have been a growing number of studies that suggest that marijuana use in emerging adults is associated with differences in brain structure and cognitive abilities,"" said Gruber, also the director of Cognitive and Clinical Neuroimaging Core at McLean Hospital outside Boston. ""I'm not saying (pot smoking) is analogous to shooting heroin or cocaine, but it's also not quite the benign substance people thought it was."" 
 
 Responding to a study that found a decline in IQ points among people who used marijuana regularly, Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, told USA TODAY recently that people should be more aware of these potential brain impacts. 
 
 ""Perhaps it would be better if ... there was a little bit more recognition of that particular consequence,"" he said. 
 
 Gregory Gerdeman, a biologist and neuropharmacologist at Eckerd College in St. Petersburg, Fla., said he has no reason to doubt the new study's findings but worries generally about marijuana research funded by federal agencies, like the Office of National Drug Control Policy, which is charged with limiting drug use. (The research was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health as well as the Office of National Drug Control Policy and Northwestern Medicine's Warren Wright Adolescent Center.) 
 
 ""If you're getting money from the drug czar's office, that money's not going to continue if you don't end up publishing something that at least supports the general story of the danger of drug abuse,"" Gerdeman said. 
 
 He said it doesn't surprise him that heavy pot smoking might make it difficult for students to reach their intellectual potential. But still, he said, ""if it were my child, even with this study, I'm more comfortable with young people having a casual marijuana habit than drinking regularly.""

 Strikes by London Underground workers could be escalated in the new year, with two or three-day walkouts considered, union leaders warned today as passengers suffered fresh delays and disruption because of the latest bout of industrial action. 
 
 Leaders of the Rail Maritime and Transport union and the Transport Salaried Staffs' Association said they would not be recommending any walkouts over the festive season, virtually ruling out any more strikes before January 10, but they raised the threat of longer stoppages after that. 
 
 Tube services were disrupted by a 24-hour walkout in protest at job losses, ending at 6.30pm tonight after causing problems for commuters, made worse by the freezing weather. 
 
 The unions clashed with Transport for London over the impact of today's strike, the fourth in recent months, with managers strongly denying accusations that they had ""misled"" passengers. 
 
 Bob Crow, general secretary of the RMT, said: ""If you believe what is on the TfL website then you believe in Father Christmas. They are using propaganda to mislead the public. They said Liverpool Street was open when it was closed and they said the Waterloo and City line was running when it wasn't."" 
 
 LU managing director Mike Brown said: ""After consulting with the union leaderships on this for more than six months, trying to establish what specific safety concerns they may have, we offered a further six weeks to discuss our plans. For them to reject this and threaten more strike action next year is staggering, and will be seen by Londoners for what it is - an attempt to hold our city to ransom. 
 
 ""It will not work. Among union members support for this strike diminishes all the time, and Londoners simply won't let this futile action stop them getting around their city. 
 
 ""Despite their ludicrous claims, the RMT and TSSA leaderships have offered absolutely no evidence that the information we are providing to help passengers get around London is anything other than accurate. They have not because they cannot - services are operating on virtually all lines today. 
 
 ""If the union leaders had been out and about on the network, as I have, they'd have seen busy trains and stations and customers going about their normal business. In fact the Tube carried half of its usual number of passengers today despite the pointless strike."" 
 
 Gerry Doherty, leader of the TSSA, said: ""When it comes to fiction, London Underground could give Dan Brown (Da Vinci Code author) a run for his money. 
 
 ""They have not told the truth about the impact of this strike from day one."" 
 
 Transport Secretary Philip Hammond called on Labour leader Ed Miliband to condemn the Tube strike, saying: ""It is time for Ed Miliband to stop dithering and speak out. 
 
 ""Londoners having to brave the cold will certainly see this strike as irresponsible. Does Ed Miliband agree with them or his union bosses?"" ||||| Meanwhile, drivers across the UK are being warned to take extra care as the working week begins amid further heavy snow and ice.

 The mercury at Llysdinam near Llandrindod Wells plunged to minus 17.3C - the principality's lowest ever temperature for November and the UK's chilliest for the month since 1985. 
 
 With much of the country blanketed in snow, Shawbury in Shropshire also dropped to minus 2.5C, Lough Fea in Northern Ireland to minus 9.2C and Church Fenton in North Yorks bottomed out at minus 11.9C 
 
 Michael Dukes of MeteoGroup, the weather division of the Press Association, said the Arctic conditions were caused by a combination of light winds, snow cover and clear skies - and could see readings down to minus 20C in Scotland later this week. 
 
 ""You are seeing some ridiculously low temperatures - it has been a bit like it is in the middle of Scandinavia,"" he said. 
 
 The UK's lowest ever recorded temperature in November was minus 23.3C recorded in Braemar, in the Scottish Highlands, on November 14, 1919. 
 
 Parts of Scotland and north east England have already seen well over a foot of snow since the start of the cold snap last week. 
 
 Eastern parts will bear the brunt of more wintry weather today and there is an added risk of drifting snow, thanks to the biting easterly winds. Temperatures will also struggle to get above freezing, even in the big cities.

"Image caption Blake Anderson shows off the wasabi plants in one of his three greenhouses on Vancouver Island in Canada 
 
 For nearly 30 years, Brian Oates has, in his words, ""pig-headedly"" devoted himself to a single pursuit: setting up the first commercial wasabi farm in North America. 
 
 Dozens of others in the US and Canada have tried to grow the plant - a type of horseradish that originates in Japan, where it is found growing naturally in rocky river beds - but almost all have failed. 
 
 The reason is simple: wasabi is deemed by most experts to be the most difficult plant in the world to grow commercially. 
 
 So what drives Mr Oates, and his business Pacific Coast Wasabi (PCW), other than his stated stubbornness? 
 
 The price. 
 
 Image caption At market rates, a kilogram of wasabi goes for around $160, making it one of the world's most lucrative crops 
 
 Fetching nearly $160 (£98) per kilogram at wholesale, in addition to being hard to nurture, wasabi is also one of the most lucrative plants on the planet. 
 
 ""It is much like gold - we expect to pay a lot for gold. Well, we expect to pay a lot for wasabi,"" says Mr Oates. 
 
 The real thing 
 
 The first thing to know about wasabi - or Wasabia japonica, as it's officially known - is that you have probably never tried the real thing. 
 
 That light green paste nestled next to the pink ginger in your box of sushi? It is most likely a mix of mustard, European horseradish, and food colouring. 
 
 In fact, by some estimates, only 5% of the wasabi served in Japanese restaurants around the world comes from the rhizome, or root, of a wasabi plant. 
 
 How to eat wasabi 
 
 Image copyright Thinkstock 
 
 The methods for eating real wasabi differ significantly from those of the powdered kind, particularly if the plant is fresh. 
 
 In its most traditional preparation, the root is stood on a grater made of a piece of sharkskin stapled to a wooden paddle. Using a circular, clockwise motion, one presses the rhizome down and a paste is formed. 
 
 The heat and flavour - significantly less bracing than imitation wasabi, but similarly sharp - last only for 10 to 15 minutes, so wasabi is grated as needed. 
 
 Nobu Ochi has been buying the wasabi Mr Oates produces from the beginning, and selling it to customers at his Zen Japanese restaurant in downtown Vancouver. 
 
 ""We send the grater out with the wasabi in it, and let them have the experience of grating fresh wasabi,"" says Mr Oichi. 
 
 ""Once they taste it, like anything else that's good, you don't want to go back to the other stuff."" 
 
 Wasabi was initially used by the Japanese many centuries ago as a way of preventing illness: the story goes that it was used on raw fish to prevent food poisoning, not because of its spicy taste. 
 
 But because wasabi is grown in a manner unlike most other crops, it has long been mostly cultivated by the Japanese for the Japanese market. 
 
 ""It's a water loving plant, but it does not grow completely submerged in water like a water lily or something,"" explains Prof Carol Miles, from the Department of Horticulture at Washington State University . 
 
 ""In general, water flows over the crop, so it's grown in water beds and that's not something we commonly do in North America."" 
 
 Hatching a seed 
 
 In addition to wasabi's unique cultivation, the problem for the would-be North American wasabi farmer has also been access - getting their hands on seeds or cuttings from which they can try to grow the plant. 
 
 Image caption Wasabi can be grown from both seeds or cuttings from a so-called ""mother"" plant 
 
 ""Access to the plant material has really been the bottleneck,"" says Prof Miles. 
 
 Mr Oates says he first became interested in farming wasabi in 1987, but it took him six years simply to get access to viable seeds from which he could grow the plant. 
 
 For years, he grew the crop in greenhouses on the University of British Columbia's (UBC's) campus in Vancouver, where he worked at the time, but kept running into problems. 
 
 Finicky wasabi, if exposed to too much humidity, would die; the wrong nutrient composition could lead to a similar fate. 
 
 And then, there was the problem of scale. 
 
 ""There seems to be an understanding in agriculture that when you keep your crop small it's fine, but then when it gets big all of these issues you didn't have before rear their ugly faces,"" says Mr Oates. 
 
 He notes in particular that wasabi is especially prone to disease when planted on a large scale. 
 
 But finally, after working with graduate students at UBC, he developed a method - which is now a trade secret - that allows wasabi to be cultivated on an industrial scale without succumbing to disease. 
 
 Money woes 
 
 Mr Oates then encountered an issue common to almost every start-up, from a farm to a technology business - where to find financing. 
 
 Image caption Brian Oates has pursued his dream of running a commercial wasabi operation since the 1980s 
 
 ""There was no-one willing to take a risk on something as unknown as wasabi,"" he says. 
 
 That forced him to embrace the model currently employed by PCW, which is essentially that of a franchise. 
 
 PCW's first commercial farm opened on Vancouver Island in 2012, and it currently has nine in total - four in British Columbia, four in Washington State, and one in New York. 
 
 The farmers have each spent $70,000 to get a licence from Mr Oates, letting them in on the secret method to grow wasabi in greenhouses. 
 
 On average, each farm has then spent $700,000 per acre of wasabi just to get up and running. 
 
 Adding the fact that wasabi takes just over a year to mature means that the farmers have to be patient before the profits start to roll in. 
 
 'The window's open' 
 
 Blake Anderson and his wife, Jane, operate a successful PCW farm on Canada's Vancouver Island. 
 
 Image caption Each acre of a wasabi farm costs approximately $700,000 to get up and running 
 
 In three greenhouses situated atop a hill, Mr Anderson has what many have long thought was impossible: a successful, commercially viable wasabi farm. 
 
 ""This one was so big that I needed to get a shovel to get it out of the ground,"" says Mr Anderson as he proudly holds up a gigantic wasabi root. 
 
 ""You'll need a football team to get the next harvest,"" jokes Mr Oates, who has come to pick up some of Mr Anderson's crop, so that it can be shipped to a network of suppliers, and then onto restaurants that will buy the wasabi for a price of up to $308 per kg. 
 
 A former truck driver, Mr Anderson says he was attracted by the challenge of wasabi. 
 
 Image caption Mr Anderson has three wasabi greenhouses on his property, built over the course of two years 
 
 Now, two years in, he says: ""We've learned an awful lot, but we're getting pretty good at it."" His 200g wasabi rhizomes are a testament to his success. 
 
 Whereas PCW previously had trouble keeping up with demand - leading to sporadic halts in orders as the company waited for crops to mature - Mr Oates now says he thinks the business can increase the total acres of wasabi it grows from 10 currently to 20 to 30 in the next few years. 
 
 Image caption The wasabi greenhouses are located in an idyllic part of Vancouver Island, a two-hour ferry ride away 
 
 ""We're in a different era now, where we can make this happen and we're not worried about shutting down,"" says Mr Oates. 
 
 ""The opportunity's there, the window's open and it's our job to make it happen."" 
 
 Potential health benefits 
 
 Now that the culinary side of the business has legs, Mr Oates and his colleague, Albert Agro, have hopes of expanding into pharmaceutical products. 
 
 Mr Agro, who is chief executive and president of Wasabia, the medical side of the business, says studies have shown that extracts of wasabi can have health benefits, such as anti-bacterial and stomach-calming properties, and the ability to help reduce wrinkles. 
 
 The difficulty, as with most plant-based medicines, is to produce enough wasabi consistently to be able to generate a product. There are efforts under way in New Zealand and China, and there are already some wasabi supplements available on the web. 
 
 Wasabia has plans to begin medical trials later this year in Malaysia, but Mr Agro says that the company is focused on the longer term, content to wait until there is enough data to back up a pharmaceutical product. ||||| Tom Amery's top secret three year mission to grow fresh wasabi is bearing fruit after he began to supply Michelin starred restaurants with the super-hot roots of the plant. 
 
 When grated down the stem, or rhizome, makes a natural wasabi paste which is traditionally used on sushi. 
 
 But now celebrity chefs, including Raymond Blanc, are buying it direct from Mr Amery and experimenting with it by including it in sauces and adding it to meat and fish dishes. 
 
 Wasabi, a plant similar to cabbage and horseradish, is notoriously difficult to grow as water flow and lighting conditions have to be exact and it takes two years to harvest. 
 
 There is also limited information available on how to grow the vegetable. 
 
 Until now it could only be purchased from shops and supermarkets that stock a powder or paste form which is mixed with mustard and horseradish flavours. 
 
 Mr Amery, who runs a large watercress farm near Bere Regis, Dorset, tried a variety of growing methods before waiting 24 months to see if he had been successful. 
 
 His firm, the Wasabi Company, started selling wasabi rhizomes direct to restaurants in August. 
 
 The Ledbury in London, which was this week named the UK's best eatery, and Raymond Blanc's Le Manoir in Oxfordshire are two of his customers. 
 
 Members of the public can also mail order the roots which come complete with a grater and instructions to make the paste. 
 
 At the moment Mr Amery is selling about 60 rhizomes a week and prices range from eight pounds to 45 pounds depending on the size. 
 
 It can be stored for at least three weeks and the paste used on sushi, sashimi, beef, pork, or mixed in with other food such as mashed potato or even in drinks. 
 
 Mr Amery, the managing director of The Wasabi Company and The Watercress Company, is keeping the location of his wasabi farm top secret to avoid the attention of competitors. 
 
 He said: ""The company has been working with watercress for about 120 years and wanted to try a new crop. 
 
 ""We knew about wasabi and wanted to try it when we discovered that the paste and powder that you buy in shops has less than 15 per cent of actual wasabi in it. 
 
 ""It was difficult to research how to grow it because no one has been successful in Europe before so we tried different methods. 
 
 ""We practised and came up with our own system based on the sawa method used in Japan, which is where the wasabi is grown in water on gravel. 
 
 ""Because it takes two years to grow we had to wait to see if we had been successful, which is probably why it hasn't been successful here before.

 People who wish to mail order the wasabi rhizomes can do so by visiting the company's website.","– One of the toughest plants in the world to grow is one that you may have think you've eaten—but probably haven't. That plant is wasabi, and the BBC reports on one man's quest to do what so many others in North America have failed at: effectively farm it on a commercial scale. Japan's rocky riverbeds are the natural habitat of the plant, and farmers looking to cultivate it in the West have faced two significant obstacles: As a Washington State horticulture professor explains, wasabi is grown in water beds, a method of farming that's not typically used here. But even planting the seed is a challenge, because they're just so tough to access. In the case of Pacific Coast Wasabi owner Brian Oates, it took him six years to get his hands on ""viable"" ones. Once he did, in 1993, the challenges didn't end: Humidity and finding the right nutrients were issues, and, once he tried to expand the scale of his crop, disease became an issue. He finally arrived at a methodology for growing wasabi on a commercial scale—a trade secret that he's since sold to a handful of farmers who operate in a franchisee-like manner. They pay $70,000 to Oates, then invest as much as $700,000 an acre to bring their crop to life—eventually. As the Telegraph reported in a look at wasabi farming, the plant takes two years to grow. But with success comes profit: A pound of wasabi fetches about $70; restaurants pay suppliers as much as twice that. But as for your experience with wasabi in a restaurant, well, you probably haven't had one. An estimated 95% of Japanese restaurants serve a paste of mustard, European horseradish, and food coloring in its stead, notes the BBC.","['Image caption Blake Anderson shows off the wasabi plants in one of his three greenhouses on Vancouver Island in Canada \n \n For nearly 30 years, Brian Oates has, in his words, ""pig-headedly"" devoted himself to a single pursuit: setting up the first commercial wasabi farm in North America. \n \n Dozens of others in the US and Canada have tried to grow the plant - a type of horseradish that originates in Japan, where it is found growing naturally in rocky river beds - but almost all have failed. \n \n The reason is simple: wasabi is deemed by most experts to be the most difficult plant in the world to grow commercially. \n \n So what drives Mr Oates, and his business Pacific Coast Wasabi (PCW), other than his stated stubbornness? \n \n The price. \n \n Image caption At market rates, a kilogram of wasabi goes for around $160, making it one of the world\'s most lucrative crops \n \n Fetching nearly $160 (£98) per kilogram at wholesale, in addition to being hard to nurture, wasabi is also one of the most lucrative plants on the planet. \n \n ""It is much like gold - we expect to pay a lot for gold. Well, we expect to pay a lot for wasabi,"" says Mr Oates. \n \n The real thing \n \n The first thing to know about wasabi - or Wasabia japonica, as it\'s officially known - is that you have probably never tried the real thing. \n \n That light green paste nestled next to the pink ginger in your box of sushi? It is most likely a mix of mustard, European horseradish, and food colouring. \n \n In fact, by some estimates, only 5% of the wasabi served in Japanese restaurants around the world comes from the rhizome, or root, of a wasabi plant. \n \n How to eat wasabi \n \n Image copyright Thinkstock \n \n The methods for eating real wasabi differ significantly from those of the powdered kind, particularly if the plant is fresh. \n \n In its most traditional preparation, the root is stood on a grater made of a piece of sharkskin stapled to a wooden paddle. Using a circular, clockwise motion, one presses the rhizome down and a paste is formed. \n \n The heat and flavour - significantly less bracing than imitation wasabi, but similarly sharp - last only for 10 to 15 minutes, so wasabi is grated as needed. \n \n Nobu Ochi has been buying the wasabi Mr Oates produces from the beginning, and selling it to customers at his Zen Japanese restaurant in downtown Vancouver. \n \n ""We send the grater out with the wasabi in it, and let them have the experience of grating fresh wasabi,"" says Mr Oichi. \n \n ""Once they taste it, like anything else that\'s good, you don\'t want to go back to the other stuff."" \n \n Wasabi was initially used by the Japanese many centuries ago as a way of preventing illness: the story goes that it was used on raw fish to prevent food poisoning, not because of its spicy taste. \n \n But because wasabi is grown in a manner unlike most other crops, it has long been mostly cultivated by the Japanese for the Japanese market. \n \n ""It\'s a water loving plant, but it does not grow completely submerged in water like a water lily or something,"" explains Prof Carol Miles, from the Department of Horticulture at Washington State University . \n \n ""In general, water flows over the crop, so it\'s grown in water beds and that\'s not something we commonly do in North America."" \n \n Hatching a seed \n \n In addition to wasabi\'s unique cultivation, the problem for the would-be North American wasabi farmer has also been access - getting their hands on seeds or cuttings from which they can try to grow the plant. \n \n Image caption Wasabi can be grown from both seeds or cuttings from a so-called ""mother"" plant \n \n ""Access to the plant material has really been the bottleneck,"" says Prof Miles. \n \n Mr Oates says he first became interested in farming wasabi in 1987, but it took him six years simply to get access to viable seeds from which he could grow the plant. \n \n For years, he grew the crop in greenhouses on the University of British Columbia\'s (UBC\'s) campus in Vancouver, where he worked at the time, but kept running into problems. \n \n Finicky wasabi, if exposed to too much humidity, would die; the wrong nutrient composition could lead to a similar fate. \n \n And then, there was the problem of scale. \n \n ""There seems to be an understanding in agriculture that when you keep your crop small it\'s fine, but then when it gets big all of these issues you didn\'t have before rear their ugly faces,"" says Mr Oates. \n \n He notes in particular that wasabi is especially prone to disease when planted on a large scale. \n \n But finally, after working with graduate students at UBC, he developed a method - which is now a trade secret - that allows wasabi to be cultivated on an industrial scale without succumbing to disease. \n \n Money woes \n \n Mr Oates then encountered an issue common to almost every start-up, from a farm to a technology business - where to find financing. \n \n Image caption Brian Oates has pursued his dream of running a commercial wasabi operation since the 1980s \n \n ""There was no-one willing to take a risk on something as unknown as wasabi,"" he says. \n \n That forced him to embrace the model currently employed by PCW, which is essentially that of a franchise. \n \n PCW\'s first commercial farm opened on Vancouver Island in 2012, and it currently has nine in total - four in British Columbia, four in Washington State, and one in New York. \n \n The farmers have each spent $70,000 to get a licence from Mr Oates, letting them in on the secret method to grow wasabi in greenhouses. \n \n On average, each farm has then spent $700,000 per acre of wasabi just to get up and running. \n \n Adding the fact that wasabi takes just over a year to mature means that the farmers have to be patient before the profits start to roll in. \n \n \'The window\'s open\' \n \n Blake Anderson and his wife, Jane, operate a successful PCW farm on Canada\'s Vancouver Island. \n \n Image caption Each acre of a wasabi farm costs approximately $700,000 to get up and running \n \n In three greenhouses situated atop a hill, Mr Anderson has what many have long thought was impossible: a successful, commercially viable wasabi farm. \n \n ""This one was so big that I needed to get a shovel to get it out of the ground,"" says Mr Anderson as he proudly holds up a gigantic wasabi root. \n \n ""You\'ll need a football team to get the next harvest,"" jokes Mr Oates, who has come to pick up some of Mr Anderson\'s crop, so that it can be shipped to a network of suppliers, and then onto restaurants that will buy the wasabi for a price of up to $308 per kg. \n \n A former truck driver, Mr Anderson says he was attracted by the challenge of wasabi. \n \n Image caption Mr Anderson has three wasabi greenhouses on his property, built over the course of two years \n \n Now, two years in, he says: ""We\'ve learned an awful lot, but we\'re getting pretty good at it."" His 200g wasabi rhizomes are a testament to his success. \n \n Whereas PCW previously had trouble keeping up with demand - leading to sporadic halts in orders as the company waited for crops to mature - Mr Oates now says he thinks the business can increase the total acres of wasabi it grows from 10 currently to 20 to 30 in the next few years. \n \n Image caption The wasabi greenhouses are located in an idyllic part of Vancouver Island, a two-hour ferry ride away \n \n ""We\'re in a different era now, where we can make this happen and we\'re not worried about shutting down,"" says Mr Oates. \n \n ""The opportunity\'s there, the window\'s open and it\'s our job to make it happen."" \n \n Potential health benefits \n \n Now that the culinary side of the business has legs, Mr Oates and his colleague, Albert Agro, have hopes of expanding into pharmaceutical products. \n \n Mr Agro, who is chief executive and president of Wasabia, the medical side of the business, says studies have shown that extracts of wasabi can have health benefits, such as anti-bacterial and stomach-calming properties, and the ability to help reduce wrinkles. \n \n The difficulty, as with most plant-based medicines, is to produce enough wasabi consistently to be able to generate a product. There are efforts under way in New Zealand and China, and there are already some wasabi supplements available on the web. \n \n Wasabia has plans to begin medical trials later this year in Malaysia, but Mr Agro says that the company is focused on the longer term, content to wait until there is enough data to back up a pharmaceutical product. ', ' Tom Amery\'s top secret three year mission to grow fresh wasabi is bearing fruit after he began to supply Michelin starred restaurants with the super-hot roots of the plant. \n \n When grated down the stem, or rhizome, makes a natural wasabi paste which is traditionally used on sushi. \n \n But now celebrity chefs, including Raymond Blanc, are buying it direct from Mr Amery and experimenting with it by including it in sauces and adding it to meat and fish dishes. \n \n Wasabi, a plant similar to cabbage and horseradish, is notoriously difficult to grow as water flow and lighting conditions have to be exact and it takes two years to harvest. \n \n There is also limited information available on how to grow the vegetable. \n \n Until now it could only be purchased from shops and supermarkets that stock a powder or paste form which is mixed with mustard and horseradish flavours. \n \n Mr Amery, who runs a large watercress farm near Bere Regis, Dorset, tried a variety of growing methods before waiting 24 months to see if he had been successful. \n \n His firm, the Wasabi Company, started selling wasabi rhizomes direct to restaurants in August. \n \n The Ledbury in London, which was this week named the UK\'s best eatery, and Raymond Blanc\'s Le Manoir in Oxfordshire are two of his customers. \n \n Members of the public can also mail order the roots which come complete with a grater and instructions to make the paste. \n \n At the moment Mr Amery is selling about 60 rhizomes a week and prices range from eight pounds to 45 pounds depending on the size. \n \n It can be stored for at least three weeks and the paste used on sushi, sashimi, beef, pork, or mixed in with other food such as mashed potato or even in drinks. \n \n Mr Amery, the managing director of The Wasabi Company and The Watercress Company, is keeping the location of his wasabi farm top secret to avoid the attention of competitors. \n \n He said: ""The company has been working with watercress for about 120 years and wanted to try a new crop. \n \n ""We knew about wasabi and wanted to try it when we discovered that the paste and powder that you buy in shops has less than 15 per cent of actual wasabi in it. \n \n ""It was difficult to research how to grow it because no one has been successful in Europe before so we tried different methods. \n \n ""We practised and came up with our own system based on the sawa method used in Japan, which is where the wasabi is grown in water on gravel. \n \n ""Because it takes two years to grow we had to wait to see if we had been successful, which is probably why it hasn\'t been successful here before. \n \n ""Until we started selling the wasabi we had to keep it very secret to protect our rights and also because we weren\'t sure what the results were going to be. \n \n ""We are now producing about 100 rhizomes a week and selling them to chefs and restaurants who have been experimenting with ways of using it in their food. \n \n ""I think it could take off as a product that individual people will want to buy as the interest in Japanese food and sushi is steadily gaining popularity. \n \n ""It could even be grown personally in back gardens in the future, not only does it have a distinct flavour but the plant is quite pretty too."" \n \n People who wish to mail order the wasabi rhizomes can do so by visiting the company\'s website.']",2

 Astronomers have found that high-speed jets from black holes pack a lot of power because they contain heavy atoms. 
 
 
 
 Black hole jets recycle matter and energy into space and can affect when and where a galaxy forms stars. “Jets from supermassive black holes help determine a galaxy’s fate — how it evolves,” said Tasso Tzioumis from CSIRO in Australia. “So we want to understand better the impact jets have on their environment.” 
 
 
 
 Astronomers have known for decades that black hole jets contain electrons, which are low-mass particles. But using the European Space Agency’s XMM-Newton space telescope and CSIRO’s Compact Array radio telescope in eastern Australia, the research team found the first evidence of heavy atoms — iron and nickel — in the jets from a typical black hole known as 4U1630-47. 
 
 
 
 An iron atom is about 100,000 times more massive than an electron. When a massive particle is moving, it carries more energy than a lighter particle moving at the same speed. “Heavy atoms have been seen in jets from one other system, SS433, but that’s a very unusual system, an oddball, whereas this system is quite typical, much more likely to represent black holes in general,” Tzioumis said. While 4U1630-47 is a small black hole, a few times the mass of the Sun, the physics of black holes is scalable, he said, meaning that the finding would apply to larger black holes. 
 
 
 
 The discovery suggests that jets are powered by the black hole’s accretion disk — a belt of hot gas swirling around the black hole — and not by the spin of the black hole itself, which would be more likely to produce jets containing only light particles. The jets from 4U1630-47 are traveling fast, at two-thirds the speed of light. When such fast-moving jets containing heavy particles smash into matter in space, they could generate gamma rays and neutrinos, which might be detectable with current and future telescopes. 
 
 ||||| Has a black hole mystery just been solved? 
 
 Writing in the journal Nature, a team of scientists said it found traces of nickel and iron in the powerful jets shooting out of black hole candidate 4U 1630-47, a small black hole just a few times the mass of our sun. It may help solve a scientific puzzle that has lingered for decades. 
 
 Astronomers have known for years that hyper-dense black holes shoot matter into the universe in high-speed streams known as relativistic jets. However, nobody knew exactly what type of material the jets were spewing. 
 
 ""It was one of the unsolved questions about relativistic jets produced in the vicinity of black holes,"" said Avi Loeb, chair of the department of astronomy at Harvard University, who was not involved with the study. ""What is their composition?"" 
 
 Everyone was in agreement that the jets would contain electrons, which have a negative charge. But the jets did not have a negative charge overall. That suggested there was something else in there with a positive charge that canceled it out. 
 
 In addition, some models of the jets suggested they were shooting lightweight electrons and positrons away from the black hole and into the universe. Others thought the jets were made of much heavier normal matter. 
 
 ""Until now, it wasn't clear whether the positive charge came from positrons, the antimatter 'opposite' of electrons, or positively charged atoms,"" study coauthor James Miller-Jones of the International Center for Radio Astronomy Research said in a statement. ""Since our results found nickel and iron in these jets, we now know that ordinary matter must be providing the positive charge."" 
 
 Because it takes a lot more energy to move normal matter than it would to move the lightweight electrons and positrons, the authors suggests that the high-speed jets are carrying more energy away from the black hole than was previously known. 
 
 The study also sheds light on another scientific debate - exactly where the jets emerge from. It has been unclear whether the jets are caused by the spin of the rotating black hole, or if they originate from the disk of matter that surrounds the black hole. 
 
 ""Our results suggest it's more likely the disk is responsible for channeling the matter into the jets, and we are planning further observations to try and confirm this,"" Miller-Jones said in the statement. 
 
 To come to these conclusions, the researchers looked at both radio waves and X-rays that were emitted by black hole 4U 1630-47. 
 
 The first time they looked, the radio wave spectrum suggested the jets were not on, and the X-ray spectrum did not reveal anything unusual. 
 
 ""The jets are not always on,"" Miller-Jones told the Los Angeles Times. ""It depends a little bit on how fast the black hole is feeding."" 
 
 But the second time the team looked, the radio waves seemed to indicate the jets were on. At the same time, the X-ray spectrum picked up the characteristic signature of iron and nickel that was off just a bit. 
 
 The scientists believe the signatures were slightly skewed because of a Doppler-like effect in space. 
 
 ""Just like a sound wave gets higher as it moves toward you and lower as it moves away from you, we saw the same effect,"" Miller-Jones said. ""The energy was shifted a little bit to higher energies when it was moving toward us, and lower when it was moving away from us."" 
 
 One especially cool result of this effect is that it allowed the researchers to determine how fast the material in the jets were moving. Their finding? A whopping 123,000 miles per second, or about 66% of the speed of light.

 Wynn had sued Francis over the latter's claims that Wynn had threatened to have him killed and buried in the desert. Testifying last week, Wynn called the accusation a ""terrible lie"" that could potentially hurt his reputation and that of his eponymous company. 
 
 ""He's unrepentant, vicious, out-of-control,"" Wynn said of Francis. 
 
 But since Wynn filed suit in 2010, Francis has maintained that the threat was real. He said music mogul Quincy Jones, his neighbor and a longtime friend of Wynn's, told him that Wynn wanted Francis dead in an email.

 Francis' team has never produced the email; Wynn said that's because it doesn't exist. 
 
 The Wynn-Francis feud stretches over a number of years and multiple lawsuits. Francis attorney David Houston has suggested that their fraught history is what riled Wynn enough to threaten Francis. 
 
 Francis made the death-threat accusations while warring with Wynn over a roughly $2-million gambling debt Francis had racked up. Francis and Wynn also battled in court over Francis' accusations that he was plied with prostitutes and drugs during his betting spree. (A Nevada judge sided with Wynn in a lawsuit over those claims.) 
 
 In questioning Wynn, Houston tried to prove that the mogul, considered a sort of elder statesman in the gaming industry, was capable of spouting off threats. Houston played part of an interview from the 1980s in which Wynn told TV reporter Meredith Vieira that he'd choke her if she didn't include certain information in her report.

Francis and Wynn also battled in court over Francis\' accusations that he was plied with prostitutes and drugs during his betting spree. (A Nevada judge sided with Wynn in a lawsuit over those claims.) \n \n In questioning Wynn, Houston tried to prove that the mogul, considered a sort of elder statesman in the gaming industry, was capable of spouting off threats. Houston played part of an interview from the 1980s in which Wynn told TV reporter Meredith Vieira that he\'d choke her if she didn\'t include certain information in her report. \n \n ""I think you heard her laugh,"" Wynn said. \n \n ""Or gasp,"" Houston replied. \n \n ALSO: \n \n Glendale bear still in a cage; move to Colorado on hold \n \n Amanda Bynes charged in two alleged hit-and-run incidents \n \n Marines accused of assaulting man outside gay bar in Long Beach \n \n — Harriet Ryan and Ashley Powers \n \n Photo: Joe Francis, left, and Steve Wynn.

"What could have a been a small story last week about a DWI arrest in Wayne County – one you would read and shake you head over – has had a “viral” impact. 
 
 Our story last week about a Newark man, who was charged with DWI made the front page because of his attitude with State Troopers and his refusal to have a mug shot taken, as it might be used in “that rag” (his reference to our fine newspaper). 
 
 Here is a recap of the story: 
 
 This driver was not happy that the State Trooper out of Lyons was arresting him for Driving While intoxicated. He was also upset that his mug shot would be in that “rag” (The Wayne County Times) and that the Trooper and the paper would ruin his family. 
 
 It all began when State Police received a report of a driver swerving on Route 31 in Palmyra at 10:07 p.m. on Thursday (12/29). The trooper found the vehicle, swerving over the center line and onto the shoulder of the road. The vehicle finally stopped after traveling a distance down the shoulder of Route 31. 
 
 Subsequently, Joseph Talbot, age 43, of West Avenue in Newark failed roadside sobriety tests and was arrested for DWI. He refused a roadside pre-screen breath test and station breath test to determine his blood alcohol level. 
 
 Once at the State Police barracks, Talbot told the Trooper he was an “asshole” and was ruining his family. He refused to have his fingerprints and mug shot taken and his rant was that he might be included in the Times with his arrest and mug shot. 
 
 The troopers explained that, by refusing to have his prints and mug shot taken, he would only make it a bigger story in the paper. Following Talbot’s refusal to be processed, he was additionally charged with misdemeanor Obstruction of Governmental Administration in the 2nd Degree, along with the DWI and traffic violations. 
 
 Talbot was arraigned and remanded to jail on $750 cash/$1500 bond to reappear in Palmyra Town Court on February 1st. He was also issued an appearance ticket for Lyons Town Court on the Obstruction charge. 
 
 —————————————– 
 
 Talbot was, of course, embarrassed and was hoping to keep people from seeing the story. So….he decided to follow our delivery trucks and buy out all the Times from newsstands in Newark. 
 
 The Times staff received a call from one of the stands (Joey’s Northside) in Newark, saying a man, who they recognized from the front page photo, had just come in a bought up all their papers. Editor, Ron Holdraker, called a few other newsstands and found that it seemed to be a pattern. 
 
 With several hundred papers left at the office from a print overrun, he loaded his car and drove to Newark to see where a void existed. The Wegmans grocery store in Newark, who generally receives 250 papers, showed the shelf to be empty! He left about 150 more. The next stops at ExpressMart, KwikFill, Bodine’s Market, Arrowmart, Joey’s Northside all were replenished, as they were also depleted. 
 
 When Ron returned to the office, the story, which was also on our website (waynetimes.com) had been picked up by our news partners, 13WHAM news. They ran the story of the “Newark man, arrested for DWI, allegedly refuses mug shot to avoid publication”. The story was mentioned on their newscast and their Facebook page. The ABC affiliate stations picked up on the story as did the the Associated Press. Other news stations and affiliates followed suit. 
 
 Soon, the small story in a local newspaper, was making national news…all because the newsmaker wanted to keep things quiet. 
 
 As on Thursday, NBC’s Today Show featured the story on its “Trending Now” section, the New York Post published the story, the Washington Post, and Time magazine’s on-line edition, ran with it. The “Inside Edition” TV show and several national news media called the Times to interview our Editor about the story. A google search of “Man tries to buy papers to hide arrest” showed 22 hits, including… Britain’s Daily Mail! 
 
 All mentioned that calls made to Mr. Talbot’s phone went unanswered and messages were not returned. ||||| PALMYRA, N.Y. (AP) — The owner of a weekly upstate New York newspaper says a man bought hundreds of copies in an unsuccessful effort to keep people from reading about his drunken-driving arrest. 
 
 State police arrested Joseph Talbot on Dec. 29 in Wayne County and charged him with driving while intoxicated. 
 
 Police also charged him with refusing to be fingerprinted or photographed. They say he told troopers he didn't want his mugshot in the newspaper. 
 
 The 12,000-circulation Times of Wayne County says it obtained a mugshot from the county jail. It says it printed the mugshot and a story on New Year's Eve and published them online. 
 
 Newspaper owner and editor Ron Holdraker says Talbot bought nearly 1,000 newsstand copies at $1.25 each.

"Image copyright NZ Defence Force Image caption New Zealand's Air Force released this image of the survivors adrift in the Pacific 
 
 Eight survivors from a ferry missing in the Kiribati archipelago have been rescued in the Pacific Ocean. 
 
 The MV Butiraoi went missing nearly two weeks ago with 50 people on board. 
 
 The eight people were picked up by a fishing boat after they were spotted from air in a small dinghy, the New Zealand Defence Force said. 
 
 Search operations continued on Monday with rescuers saying there may yet be more survivors out at sea. 
 
 New Zealand and Fiji are among the countries assisting in the search and rescue operation. 
 
 A New Zealand military plane had found the 5m (16ft) dinghy adrift on Sunday morning. The New Zealand Defence Force had initially given the number of survivors on board as seven. 
 
 The crew had airdropped essential supplies and radio equipment to the survivors. Later on Sunday, the group were picked up by a fishing vessel. 
 
 John Ashby, from the New Zealand Rescue Coordination Centre, said the dinghy was one of two believed to have been carried by the MV Butiraoi. 
 
 ""The group seem very relieved to have been found,"" he added, noting that sea conditions were ""moderate to rough"". 
 
 No further details about the fate of the 17.5m (57ft) wooden catamaran or its other passengers were given. 
 
 Image caption The ferry left the island of Nonouti ahead of a 260km (160 miles) journey to Betio. 
 
 The Butiraoi left Nonouti Island on 18 January on a 250km (155 mile) journey to the island of Betio, a journey which was expected to take two days. 
 
 The vessel had undergone repairs to its propeller shaft just before the journey. 
 
 After a week with no sign of the boat, New Zealand began offering assistance. 
 
 ""We are always ready to play our part at home and in the region to help those in need,"" it said in a statement at the start of its involvement.

 Australian and American rescue teams have joined the search for survivors from the Kiribati ferry that capsized in the central Pacific more than a week ago. 
 
 It was initially estimated that around 50 people were onboard, but according to Kiribati’s president, Taneti Mamau, up to 100 people may have been passengers. 
 
 Missing Kiribati ferry: seven passengers found in lifeboat Read more 
 
 The president declared a week of prayer in the hope that more survivors would be found as rescue efforts were stepped up, RNZ reported. 
 
 Aircraft from Australia and the US Coast Guard will join the search for the MV Butiraoi and its passengers, seven of whom were rescued from a wooden dingy on Sunday after scrambling aboard the flimsy vessel after the ferry sank. 
 
 A search and rescue aircraft from the Australian Maritime Safety Authority will start searching west of Kiribati on Monday, while the US Coast Guard’s C-130 Hercules will arrive on Tuesday. 
 
 The rescue effort is being run from Fiji by New Zealand’s rescue coordination centre, more than 2,000km south-west of Kiribati, which has a population of around 100,000. 
 
 Greg Johnston, senior search and rescue officer with the coordination centre, said a New Zealand air force P-3 Orion aircraft had spent all day Monday searching an area bigger than the whole of New Zealand – 385,000 sq km. 
 
 The remoteness of the search area, which lies 800km west of Kiribati, was adding to the challenge of the rescue effort, Johnston said. 
 
 A Kiribati marine patrol boat with medical personnel was en route to the FV Lomalo, the fishing boat which picked up the seven survivors on Sunday. 
 
 The survivors on the dinghy were reported to be in “reasonable health” despite spending more than a week at sea without water, an engine, or a radio to call for help. 
 
 Three men – two in their 20s and one aged 34 – and four females – three in their 20s and one aged 14 – were found on the basic wooden dingy. 
 
 A New Zealand airforce Orion dropped emergency supplies of food, water and a radio from the air on Sunday, after spotting them 180km from the nearest major island. 
 
 Butiraoi, an inter-island passenger ferry, left Nonouti Island on 18 January for a two-day, 250km trip to Betio, the largest township of Kiribati’s capital city, South Tarawa. The 17-metre wooden catamaran failed to arrive as scheduled on 20 January. 
 
 Local authorities said the boat had run aground and undergone repairs to its propeller shaft before it left Nonouti. It has a high frequency radio but it is not known whether it had enough fuel and emergency supplies on board. ||||| WELLINGTON, New Zealand — Searchers examined an expanding zone of the Pacific Ocean around the islands of Kiribati on Monday in hopes of finding more survivors of a ferry sinking after rescuers found seven passengers alive on an aluminum dinghy following more than a week at sea. 
 
 The 56-foot wooden catamaran that vanished on Jan. 18 was believed to have been carrying at least 50 other passengers. On Friday, the New Zealand authorities were first alerted by the government of Kiribati — which is about halfway between Hawaii and Australia — that the vessel had vanished after leaving for what was supposed to be a two-day, 150-mile voyage. 
 
 New Zealand’s military joined the search the next day, and rescued seven people, including a 14-year-old girl, on the small dinghy. A spokesman for the operation said the group had survived “in the baking sun” for more than a week without supplies, shade or a motor for the dinghy. 
 
 Air Commodore Darryn Webb said Monday that the seven survivors were still on the fishing boat that had rescued them, because New Zealand’s military needed it to stay in the area in case more survivors were spotted during an air search.","– A search and rescue operation is heating up in the Pacific Ocean near Kiribati, where passengers from a missing ferry were discovered Sunday. The 56-foot MV Butiraoi ferry was carrying at least 50 people, and perhaps 100, when it departed on a two-day, 150-mile trip from Nonouti to the island of Betio on Jan. 18, reports the BBC. It didn't arrive as scheduled and, for unknown reasons, New Zealand's military—which is responsible for patrolling the area in question—wasn't notified until a week later, reports the New York Times. An air search began on Saturday, and seven passengers—including a 14-year-old girl—were found floating in a 16-foot aluminum dinghy on Sunday, a search spokesman tells the Times. The BBC counts the number of survivors at eight. An air commodore says the survivors are ""pretty dehydrated"" after a week ""in the baking sun."" The Guardian notes they didn't have water. Picked up by a fishing boat more than 100 miles from the nearest major island, they reportedly said the ferry split in two and sank; the vessel underwent repairs to a propeller shaft before departing after it ran aground on an atoll. Still, officials are optimistic that more survivors may be found. Kiribati's president, Taneti Maamau, says 100 people might've been on board the ferry, which had two dinghies, per the New Zealand Herald. Australian and American rescue teams are now en route to help search a 200,000-square-mile area 500 miles west of Kiribati, a country made up of 33 atolls located halfway between Hawaii and Australia, per the Guardian.","['Image copyright NZ Defence Force Image caption New Zealand\'s Air Force released this image of the survivors adrift in the Pacific \n \n Eight survivors from a ferry missing in the Kiribati archipelago have been rescued in the Pacific Ocean. \n \n The MV Butiraoi went missing nearly two weeks ago with 50 people on board. \n \n The eight people were picked up by a fishing boat after they were spotted from air in a small dinghy, the New Zealand Defence Force said. \n \n Search operations continued on Monday with rescuers saying there may yet be more survivors out at sea. \n \n New Zealand and Fiji are among the countries assisting in the search and rescue operation. \n \n A New Zealand military plane had found the 5m (16ft) dinghy adrift on Sunday morning.

"There’s an old phrase: “To someone with a hammer, everything is a nail.” 
 
 Asteroids are the ultimate hammers. After all, an asteroid impact can certainly pound a nail into the toughest medium! Because of that they’re blamed for all sorts of features in the solar system. But a new paper claims that one of the largest features on the Moon—Oceanus Procellarum, the “Ocean of Storms”—was actually not caused by a giant impact, as has long been thought.

 Procellarum is a huge flattened region of the Moon, dark lowlands dominating the Moon’s northwest face. It’s part of the fabled “Man in the Moon” formation. The region is a good 3,200 kilometers (1,800 miles) wide, which is huge. The overall shape was always assumed to be circular, but to be fair it’s difficult to say. 
 
 Phil Plait Phil Plait writes Slate’s Bad Astronomy blog and is an astronomer, public speaker, science evangelizer, and author of Death From the Skies! 
 
 It formed long ago, about 3.5 billion years ago, and subsequent impacts (some of which have been huge) have distorted the outer boundaries. Because of its huge size and assumed roundness, its origin has generally been attributed to something very large hitting the Moon, punching through the crust. Magma welled up, creating vast plains, which eventually became the Procellarum we see today. 
 
 But the new study challenges that. Researchers used gravity data to look at features in and below the surface, and get a different story. The data came from GRAIL, twin spacecraft that orbited the Moon in formation. The Moon isn’t a homogeneous sphere; it’s lumpy, with places under the surface with higher and lower densities. This means those regions will have higher and lower gravitational pull. As the first spacecraft flew over such a region, it would speed up or slow down relative to the second one. This could then be used to determine the density of the underlying terrain.

 What they found was not what was expected: A series of long, narrow features that look like rift structures, places where the Moon’s crust is thinner, and which are generally associated with upwelling magma. The structures form a rough square or pentagon that neatly outlines the lowlands.

 This changes the way they interpret the formation of Procellarum. Instead of a single huge impact, these rifts formed and magma started to seep (or more likely flood) through. It flowed downhill, toward the interior of the polygon. Eventually, the pressure from the weight of the overlying lava compressed the crust, closing the rifts, shutting off the flood. The lava plains cooled, and later impacts formed the other basins seen overlapping it. 
 
 The scale of this is mind-numbing: Imagine an eruption of lava so big and so long-lasting it flooded 2.5 million square kilometers of lunar surface! That's an area a quarter the size of the entire United States. 
 
 Yikes.

 Despite its apocalyptic nature, there’s a lot to like about this new idea. The observations make a neat fit, for one thing. For another, I’ve always had a problem with the impact idea; the size of the impact was so big it should’ve had lots of secondary effects. For example, the shock wave in the crust would have traveled around the Moon, converging on the spot on the opposite side (called the antipode). This dumps lot of energy there, and you should see chaotic, jumbled terrain in that area (this is seen with Mare Imbrium, or “Sea of Rains”, for example). Yet there’s no indication of such a feature.* 
 
 This paper just came out, and knowing scientists as I do, I expect there to be a lot of discussion and arguing over the data and results. That’s a rock-solid (har har) guarantee when a new idea challenges a long-established one, especially when it’s something as basic as the formation of a huge feature. 
 
 But that’s part of the fun! Now we have to figure out which idea is not just good, but better, and then think of ways of testing them both to compare them. One idea may win, or maybe both will (sometimes multiple causes form a single feature), or maybe a third idea will well out of the cracks.† Remember, this new idea was only made possible due to new ways of studying the Moon (GRAIL flew in 2012). The more we study our nearest cosmic neighbor, the more likely it is we’ll find surprises lurking just below the surface.‡ 
 
 * Though I did find a paper saying the Procellarum may have been formed due to antipodal effects of the South Pole Aitken Basin, which is interesting.

 For years scientists have believed that a vast plain of solidified lava on the nearside of the Moon — known as Oceanus Procellarum — was shaped by an asteroid that slammed into the orb billions of years ago.

 But now an analysis of a gravitational map of the 3,200-kilometre-wide ancient volcanic region suggests that it is not a giant impact crater after all. A study that reveals features of the crust beneath the surface shows that the area is rimmed by structures that run in straight lines and intersect at angles, similarly to a rectangle. Such a shape is hard to attribute to a collision, which would be expected to produce a more circular rim, and could instead be the result of geological activity within the Moon's crust. 
 
 In the study, published in Nature1 on 1 October, the researchers used data from NASA’s Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) mission, which ended in late 2012. GRAIL’s twin spacecraft measured changes in the Moon’s gravitational field caused by variations in the density and topography of the crust below. The map revealed anomalies buried beneath the plains' basalt surface, which the authors interpret as valleys where the crust of the Moon has been stretched and thinned, a process that on Earth happens as tectonic plates move apart. On the Moon, these rift valleys were later filled in with lava flows. 
 
 The findings were unexpected, says Jeffrey Andrews-Hanna, a planetary scientist at the Colorado School of Mines in Golden who led the study and was a member of the GRAIL science team. ""Rift zones aren’t something known on the Moon, although we see them on Earth, Venus and Mars,” he says. 
 
 Previously scientists had thought the Procellarum was an impact basin based on its low-elevation, distinctive composition -- which includes higher than average levels of elements such as uranium, thorium and potassium -- as well as fragments of surface structures that looked like the remnants of a rim. But Andrews-Hanna and colleagues have a new explanation. They say that the region's high concentrations of radioactive elements would have made the area hotter than its surroundings, and quicker to cool (see 'Gravity maps reveal why the dark side of the Moon is covered in craters'). As the region cooled and contracted, the crust at its edges would have stretched, forming valleys in the distinctive rectangular pattern, they say. The process is similar to the way fractures that form around a mud puddle as it dries, says Andrews-Hanna. 
 
 The pattern looks remarkably similar to one on Saturn’s moon Enceladus, Andrews-Hanna adds. Despite the many differences between the moons, similar physical processes may have occurred on them, he suggests. ||||| New data obtained by NASA’s GRAIL mission reveals that the Procellarum region on the near side of the moon — a giant basin often referred to as the “man in the moon” — likely arose not from a massive asteroid strike, but from a large plume of magma deep within the moon’s interior. 
 
 The Procellarum region is a roughly circular, volcanic terrain some 1,800 miles in diameter — nearly as wide as the United States. One hypothesis suggested that it was formed by a massive impact, in which case it would have been the largest impact basin on the moon. Subsequent asteroid collisions overprinted the region with smaller — although still large — basins. 
 
 Now researchers from MIT, the Colorado School of Mines, and other institutions have created a high-resolution map of the Procellarum, and found that its border is not circular, but polygonal, composed of sharp angles that could not have been created by a massive asteroid. Instead, researchers believe that the angular outline was produced by giant tension cracks in the moon’s crust as it cooled around an upwelling plume of hot material from the deep interior. 
 
 Maria Zuber, the E.A. Griswold Professor of Geophysics and also MIT’s vice president for research, says that as cracks occurred, they formed a “plumbing system” in the moon’s crust through which magma could meander to the surface. Magma eventually filled the region’s smaller basins, creating what we see today as dark spots on the near side of the moon — features that have inspired the popular notion of a “man in the moon.” 
 
 “A lot of things in science are really complicated, but I’ve always loved to answer simple questions,” says Zuber, who is principal investigator for the GRAIL (Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory) mission. “How many people have looked up at the moon and wondered what produced the pattern we see — let me tell you, I’ve wanted to solve that one!” 
 
 Zuber and her colleagues publish their results this week in the journal Nature. 
 
 Making less of an impact 
 
 The team mapped the Procellarum region using data obtained by GRAIL — twin probes that orbited the moon from January to December 2012. Researchers measured the distance between the probes as they chased each other around the moon. As the leading probe passed over a region of lower density, it briefly slowed, caught by that region’s gravitational pull. As the probes circled the moon, they moved in accordion fashion, the distance between them stretching and contracting in response to varying gravitational attraction due to the mass variations in the lunar interior. 
 
 From the variable distance between the probes, Zuber and her team determined the strength of gravity across the moon’s surface, creating a highly detailed map, which they then used to determine where the lunar crust thickens and thins. 
 
 From this mapping, the researchers observed that the rim of the Procellarum region is composed of edges that abut at 120-degree angles. As asteroid impacts tend to produce circular or elliptical craters, Zuber says the Procellarum’s angular shape could not have been caused by an impact. 
 
 Instead, the team explored an alternative scenario: Some time after the moon formed and cooled, a large plume of molten material rose from the lunar interior, around where the Procellarum region is today. The steep difference in temperature between the magma plume and the surrounding crust caused the surface to contract over time, creating a pattern of fractures that provided a conduit for molten material to rise to the surface. 
 
 To test the hypothesis, the researchers modeled the region’s gravitational signal if it were to contain volcanic intrusions — magma that seeped up to just beneath the moon’s surface and, over time, cooled and crystallized. The resulting simulation matched the gravity signal recorded by GRAIL, supporting the idea that the Procellarum was caused by a magma plume, and not an asteroid. 
 
 “How such a plume arose remains a mystery,” Zuber says. “It could be due to radioactive decay of heat-producing elements in the deep interior. Or, conceivably, a very early large impact triggered the plume. But in the latter case, all evidence for such an impact has been completely erased. People who thought that all this volcanism was related to a gigantic impact need to go back and think some more about that.” 
 
 Ultimately, proving that the moon may have harbored an ancient plume may require a new lunar mission, involving a long-lived geophysical network to monitor seismic and heat signals from the deep interior, according to Clive Neal, a professor of civil and environmental engineering and earth sciences at the University of Notre Dame. 
 
 “It comes to trying to understand the nature of the interior, and how extensive was this concentration of heat-producing elements that would’ve caused a plume to surface,” says Neal, who was not involved in the research. “GRAIL has been a fantastic mission, and this data will be continually used and reinterpreted as we get more data back from the moon. I don’t think we’ve seen the last of this data by a long shot.”","– Scientists know it as Oceanus Procellarum, but the rest of us generally refer to it as the ""Man on the Moon""—the huge dark splotch on the moon visible from Earth. Either way, how did it get there? One commonly held view is that a massive asteroid slammed into the young moon and left its mark. But researchers at MIT say they've got new evidence showing that the 1,800-mile-wide region came not from beyond but from within, specifically from a volcanic eruption that unleashed a ""large plume of magma deep within the moon's interior."" As the lava made its way to the surface and cooled, it created the dark spots we see today, reports the Telegraph. In their study, researchers say one of the giveaways is that new data from NASA shows that the region's border is not actually round, but is instead ""rimmed by structures that run in straight lines and intersect at angles, similarly to a rectangle,"" explains Nature. ""Such a shape is hard to attribute to a collision, which would be expected to produce a more circular rim."" Definitive proof might not come unless astronauts return to the moon, but in the meantime, astronomy writer Phil Plait at Slate thinks the theory makes sense. ""I’ve always had a problem with the impact idea,"" he writes, adding that the ""secondary effects"" that would have accompanied such a huge meteor strike don't appear to be evident.

 A father trying to protect his 6-year-old daughter when a big top tent gave way during a circus performance Monday in New Hampshire was fatally struck by a flying pole, his heartbroken son said. 
 
 ""The beam came down on top of my father — crushed his skull,"" Jonathan Young, who was at work when the accident occurred at 5:30 p.m., told NBC affiliate WHDH on Tuesday. 
 
 ""He was protecting my little sister, Annabelle, at the time,"" Young added, choking back tears. ""Unfortunately, she didn't make it as well."" 
 
 Robert Young, 41, and daughter Annabelle, of Concord, Vermont, were identified Tuesday as the two fatalities at the Lancaster Fairgrounds, about 90 miles north of Concord. Robert Young's wife and another daughter who were also in the audience were unharmed.

 Jonathan Young said his family recounted the ""panic and chaos"" as severe weather forced the red- and yellow-striped tent to collapse, pinning dozens of people underneath. Despite earlier concerns about the weather, workers with the Walker Brothers International Circus continued on with the show. 
 
 Fire officials are investigating why the tent failed as 60 mph winds blew across the fairgrounds. 
 
 At a news conference Tuesday morning, State Fire Marshal Bill Degnan said Walker Brothers International did not have the proper ""place of assembly"" permit to hold the show and were investigating whether they are criminally culpable. Officials are also determining if the group heeded weather warnings. Forecasts called for severe storms and hail. 
 
 ""Their responsibility is for the safety of their guests,"" Degnan said. ""Whether they knew or not that the storm was coming, we'll be looking into that.""

 About 32 people among the 100 guests had to be hospitalized, fire officials said. 
 
 ""To me it didn't seem like anything was down tight because (the stakes) came up quick,"" said Meagan Marion, who was at the event with her 9-year-old son, Trevor, and her mother. ""It didn't even seem like they were in the ground."" 
 
 The injured included Marion's mom, who suffered a head injury when a pole slammed into her, her family said. 
 
 ""She didn't move nothing,"" Marion told NBC News. ""Her eyes were rolled in the back of her head. It was scary."" 
 
 After Marion found her mother, she feared the worst. But her mother was breathing and remains hospitalized at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center and is in a neck brace. She won't be able to return to work for two months, Marion said. 
 
 The event has traumatized the family. Marion said she saw Annabelle's body behind her alongside a man later identified as the girl's father.

 LANCASTER — A father and his young daughter from Concord, Vt., have been identified as the victims of a fatal circus-tent collapse Monday at the Lancaster Fairgrounds.Robert Young, 41, and Annabelle Young, 8, died from blunt-force trauma, according to State Fire Marshal William Degnan. Officials said a microburst packing winds up to 90 mph, heavy rain, lightning and hail struck the fairgrounds when the Walker Brothers International Circus of Sarasota, Fla., was 16 minutes into its 5:30 p.m. performance.The wind picked up the tent, bringing down its steel infrastructure on the audience of approximately 100. Degnan said Tuesday that 32 people were injured, some seriously.Degnan said Walker Brothers did not have a municipal place-of-assembly permit, adding that no state or local officials inspected the tent prior to Monday’s show.“They just went, set up and did it,” he said of Walker Brothers.Degnan said that his investigation will look at how the tent was erected and will also include a review of building and fire codes. He said had Walker Brothers notified the town that it was erecting a circus tent, the Fire Department would have inspected it. Degnan also said that it was Walker Brothers’ duty to follow weather reports and to pass along warnings from the National Weather Service to the audience.Walker Brothers did not respond to an e-mail from the Union Leader seeking comment, but Degnan noted that he had been in contact with the company, which he said initially wanted to consult with its legal counsel, but which later on Tuesday cooperated “greatly” with investigators.The Walker Brothers International Circus cancelled two shows that were scheduled for Tuesday in Bradford, Vt., but not shows set for later this week in Grafton, Contoocook and Wolfeboro.After learning of Annabelle Young’s death, Concord School Principal Julie Donahue posted this on the Vermont school’s Facebook Page : “Words cannot begin our sorrow for the family affected by the tragic accident at the Lancaster Fairgrounds that resulted in the death of a Concord student and a Concord parent ...

 The New Hampshire Fire Marshal has identified the victims as 41-year-old Robert Young, of Concord, Vermont and his 8-year-old Annabelle. 
 
 The storm moved in quickly with winds reaching up to 75 miles an hour. A warning was in effect for the area during the circus performance. 
 
 Jonathan Young, the son and brother of the two victims, said his mother told him the people with the circus reassured the audience that everything was alright despite the weather warnings.

He said had Walker Brothers notified the town that it was erecting a circus tent, the Fire Department would have inspected it. Degnan also said that it was Walker Brothers’ duty to follow weather reports and to pass along warnings from the National Weather Service to the audience.Walker Brothers did not respond to an e-mail from the Union Leader seeking comment, but Degnan noted that he had been in contact with the company, which he said initially wanted to consult with its legal counsel, but which later on Tuesday cooperated “greatly” with investigators.The Walker Brothers International Circus cancelled two shows that were scheduled for Tuesday in Bradford, Vt., but not shows set for later this week in Grafton, Contoocook and Wolfeboro.After learning of Annabelle Young’s death, Concord School Principal Julie Donahue posted this on the Vermont school’s Facebook Page : “Words cannot begin our sorrow for the family affected by the tragic accident at the Lancaster Fairgrounds that resulted in the death of a Concord student and a Concord parent ...

 Kushner, who also serves as a senior White House adviser, will be admitted to the Order of the Aztec Eagle because of “his significant contributions” to a new North American trade pact agreed to in August, the government said in a statement. 
 
 Kushner has often played a key diplomatic role in Trump’s administration, meeting with Mexican and other foreign leaders and helping broker the deal to update the 24-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement. Canada joined the pact in late September. 
 
 The award is expected to be formally presented to Kushner on Thursday by outgoing President Enrique Pena Nieto on the sidelines of the G-20 summit of world leaders in Buenos Aires, Mexican newspaper Reforma reported on Tuesday, citing unidentified government sources. 
 
 The summit is also where the leaders of Mexico, the United States and Canada are expected to sign the revamped regional trade deal. 
 
 The honor bestowed on Kushner was a trending topic on Twitter, where it appeared to be mostly criticized by prominent Mexicans. 
 
 “Giving him the Aztec Eagle reflects a supreme attitude of humiliation and cowardice,” Mexican historian Enrique Krauze wrote in one post, noting that Trump called Mexican migrants murderers and rapists during his 2016 presidential campaign. 
 
 Mexican actor Gael Garcia Bernal wrote that the decision to honor Kushner was “tremendously shameful.” 
 
 Past Order of the Aztec Eagle honorees include Colombian Nobel literature laureate Gabriel Garcia Marquez and former South African President Nelson Mandela.

 Enrique Peña Nieto to hand Trump son-in-law the Order of the Aztec Eagle for trade work 
 
 The outgoing Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto has stunned the country by bestowing the nation’s highest honour for foreigners on Jared Kushner, the senior White House adviser and son-in-law of Donald Trump. 
 
 Peña Nieto praised Kushner as “a grand ally of Mexico” who helped achieve a renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement between the US, Canada and Mexico. 
 
 The revised agreement – now known as Usmca – is expected to be signed in Buenos Aires during the G20 summit. Peña Nieto will decorate Kushner with the Order of the Aztec Eagle in the Argentinian capital this week. 
 
 Peña Nieto was quoted by Mexican media as saying: “He has been an important actor in this objective of having a good understanding of the new government that entered two years ago.” 
 
 Trump repeatedly disparaged Mexicans during his improbable rise to power. He still threatens to close the US-Mexico border over a caravan of Central American migrants in the city of Tijuana. 
 
 Mexicans on Tuesday voiced their outrage over Kushner receiving the Order of the Aztec Eagle, whose past recipients include Queen Elizabeth and Nelson Mandela. 
 
 “Giving [Kushner] the Aztec Eagle is a supreme act of humiliation and cowardice,” tweeted historian Enrique Krauze. 
 
 Carlos Bravo Regidor, a professor at the Centre for Research and Teaching in Economics, said: “This is the perfect ending for Peña Nieto’s term: an insuperable illustration of the indignity of his government’s position regarding Trump. 
 
 “It’s the final kick in the crotch for Mexicans.” 
 
 This is what Trump’s caravan 'invasion' really looks like Read more 
 
 In August 2016, the then finance minister Luis Videgaray – now the foreign minister – convinced Peña Nieto to invite then candidate Trump to Mexico City for a meeting at the presidential palace. In a joint media appearance afterwards, Trump again pledged to build a border wall between the United States and Mexico. 
 
 Peña Nieto appeared acquiescent as he stayed silent – at least until Trump left the country. At a campaign rally later that night, Trump continued to publicly criticise Mexico. 
 
 Kushner is thought to have forged a close relationship with Videgaray, who resigned from cabinet after the fiasco of Trump’s visit to Mexico, but was brought back to the foreign ministry on the eve of the US presidential inauguration. Analysts say Mexico has pursued a “son-in-law strategy” in its attempts to deal with the Trump administration. 
 
 Bravo said the jury was still out on the strategy’s success. “It has all happened behind closed doors,” he said. “It’s palace politics. At its worst.” 
 
 Peña Nieto leaves office as a loathed figure on 30 November after six years of corruption and conflict-of-interest scandals. His approval rating hovers at just 24%, according to pollster Consulta Mitofsky.","– Enrique Peña Nieto's final ""major"" act as president will apparently involve Jared Kushner, and it's one the Guardian describes as having ""stunned the country"": The Hill reports that before handing over power to incoming president Andrés Manuel López Obrador on Saturday, Peña Nieto will bestow Mexico's highest honor for foreigners on Kushner for his work on renegotiating NAFTA. The ceremony in which Kushner will receive the Order of the Aztec Eagle will take place Thursday during the G20 summit, putting him in a club that includes Walt Disney, Queen Elizabeth, Nelson Mandela, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, and Bill and Melinda Gates.

 The characters in this movie should be arrested for loitering with intent to moan. Never have teenagers been in greater need of a jump-start. Granted some of them are more than 100 years old, but still: their charisma is by Madame Tussaud. 
 
 ""The Twilight Saga: New Moon"" takes the tepid achievement of ""Twilight"" (2008), guts it, and leaves it for undead. You know you're in trouble with a sequel when the word of mouth advises you to see the first movie twice instead. Obviously the characters all have. Long opening stretches of this film make utterly no sense unless you walk in knowing the first film, and hopefully both Stephanie Meyer novels, by heart. Edward and Bella spend murky moments glowering at each other and thinking, So, here we are again. 
 
 
 
 Bella (Kristen Stewart) is still living at home with her divorced dad (Billy Burke), a cop whose disciplinary policy involves declaring her grounded for the rest of her life and then disappearing so she can jump from cliffs, haunt menacing forests, and fly to Italy so the movie can evoke the sad final death scene from--why, hold on, it's Romeo and Juliet! The very play Edward was reciting narcissistically and contemptuously in an opening scene. 
 
 
 
 Yes, Edward (Robert Pattinson) is back in school, repeating the 12th grade for the 84th time. Bella sees him in the school parking lot, walking toward her in slow-motion, wearing one of those Edwardian Beatles jackets with a velvet collar, pregnant with his beauty. How white his skin, how red his lips. The decay of middle age may transform him into the Joker. 
 
 
 
 Edward and the other members of the Cullen vampire clan stand around a lot with glowering skulks. Long pauses interrupt longer ones. Listen up, lads! You may be immortal, but we've got a train to catch. 
 
 
 
 Edward leaves, because Bella was not meant to be with him. Although he's a vegetarian vampire, when she gets a paper cut at her birthday party one of his pals leaps on her like a shark on a tuna fish. 
 
 
 
 In his absence she's befriended by Jake (Taylor Lautner), that nice American Indian boy. ""You've gotten all buff!"" she tells him. Yeah, real buff, and soon he's never wearing a shirt and standing outside in the winter rain as if he were--why, nothing more than a wild animal. They don't need coats like ours, remember, because God gave them theirs. 
 
 
 
 Those not among that five percent of the movie's target audience that doesn't already know this will (spoiler) be surprised that Jake is a werewolf. 
 
 
 
 Bella: So…you're a werewolf? 
 
 Jake: Last time I checked. 
 
 Bella: ""Can't you find a way to...just stop? 
 
 Jake (patiently): ""It's not a lifestyle choice, Bella."" 
 
 
 
 Jake is influenced, or controlled, or something, by Sam, another member of the tribe. He's like the alpha wolf. Sam and his three friends are mostly seen in long shot, shirtless in the rain, hanging around the edges of the clearing as if hoping to dash in and pick off some fresh meat. 
 
 
 
 Bella writes long letters to her absent vampire friend Alice (Ashley Greene), in which she does nothing to explain why she is helplessly attracted to these sinister, humorless and vain men. It can't be the sex. As I've already explained in my review of the first film, The Twilight Saga is an extended metaphor for teen chastity, in which the punishment for being deflowered I will leave to your imagination. 
 
 
 
 The movie includes beauteous fields filled with potted flowers apparently buried hours before by the grounds crew, and nobody not clued in on the plot. Since they know it all and we know all, sitting through this experience is like driving a tractor in low gear though a sullen sea of Brylcreem. ||||| Twilight: New Moon ROMANCE/HORROR: United States, 2009 U.S. Release Date: 2009-11-20 Running Length: 2:10 MPAA Classification: PG-13 (Profanity, Mature Themes) Theatrical Aspect Ratio: 2.35:1 Cast: Kristen Stewart, Robert Pattinson, Taylor Lautner, Anna Kendrick, Ashley Greene, Billy Burke, Michael Sheen, Dakota Fanning Director: Chris Weitz Screenplay: Melissa Rosenberg, based on the novel by Stephanie Meyer Cinematography: Javier Aguirresarobe Music: Alexandre Desplat U.S. Distributor: Summit Entertainment Subtitles: none 
 
 Note: An argument can be made that this review contains spoilers for New Moon. For those who have read the book, there is no spoilage. For those who have watched the trailer, there is no spoilage. For those who don't fit into either of those categories, the question of whether or not there is spoilage is probably irrelevant. Nevertheless, you have been warned. 
 
 Twilight fans remind me of those who identified themselves with Star Trek in early and mid-1970s, Star Wars in the late-1970s and early-1980s, and Harry Potter in the first years of this decade: individuals who have embraced a fictional universe and are so enamored with it that they are willing to excuse its shortcomings. In a way, that's a positive thing, because the second entry in the Twilight cycle, New Moon, is - at least from the perspective of an outsider - not a particularly good movie. It's cheesy, poorly focused, and features some borderline-awful dialogue and performances. None of that will matter to Twilight fans and, just as Star Trek fans forgave V'ger and Star Wars fans bravely endured the Ewoks, this group will ignore the flaws to concentrate on what works. The thrill of seeing their favorite characters once again on screen will eclipse all else. But the world is not comprised solely of Twilight fans - they are a minority, albeit a vocal one. This review is not for them; it's for the rest of us. 
 
 By all accounts, New Moon is reasonably faithful to the book, although I can't say for certain, not having been able to get past page 50 of Twilight due to the awkward and juvenile nature of Stephanie Meyer's prose. Director Chris Weitz (The Golden Compass) seems unwilling to cut things that would make for a tighter, faster-paced movie for fear or aggravating fans who want every moment from the book to be included. Thus we get a film bogged down by the same lackluster approach that limited the first two Harry Potter pictures - the failure to recognize that the best movie adaptations of books are ones that begin with the recognition that literature and cinema are different media and a rote interpretation of the former into the latter is rarely satisfying to anyone not slavishly devoted to the source material. 
 
 Twilight was all about the teen romance between Bella (Kristen Stewart), the 18-year old high school student, and Edward (Robert Pattinson), the 109-year old ""vampire"" who looks like he's about Bella's age. New Moon picks up where the first movie ended, with Bella and Edward playing the girlfriend/boyfriend game until she gets a paper cut in front of Edward's family and all hell breaks loose. Edward rather stupidly decides that the safest course for Bella - despite the fact that there are other vampires seeking to kill her - is for him to vanish from her life, so he does that. Bella spends the next 30 minutes of screen time moping around until she is rescued from her distress by Jacob (Taylor Lautner), who has been carrying a torch for her since they first met. But, just as he and Bella are getting closer, Jacob discovers he's a werewolf. And Bella gets some disturbing news about Edward that forces her to make a choice between trying to resolve her differences with the buff boy who sometimes goes vampire-hunting in a pack or the undead guy with an unwholesome fondness for Romeo & Juliet. 
 
 Yes, it's all very cheesy with dialogue that even a writer of purple prose might chuckle at, but it wouldn't cause nearly as much cringing if the filmmakers injected a little self-aware humor into the proceedings. New Moon comes dangerously close to self-parody on more than one occasion, but it seems blissfully unaware of this and soldiers on with a seriousness that's unintentionally funny. The highlight comes late in the proceedings when we are treated to a dream sequence of a future Bella and Edward frolicking in a field. Although this is supposed to be giddy and romantic, it is laugh-aloud hilarious. 
 
 The movie's focal point is Bella's romantic choice: does she go with the soulful, suffering Edward (who always seems to be walking toward the camera in slow motion) or pledge herself to Jacob, who is marginally more interesting and charismatic (and who spends 3/4 of the film sans shirt and looking like he's posing for a gay porno video box cover). Based purely on physique, Jacob has the edge, but I guess there's a segment of fans who prefer Edward's goth look. When it comes to personality and chemistry, however, there's no question that Jacob is the better choice. I won't go as far as to say Taylor Lautner is a good actor, but he's an improvement over Robert Pattinson, who attempts to impersonate Bela Lugosi from Plan 9 from Outer Space. Any chemistry that may have existed between Kristen Stewart and Pattinson during Twilight has evaporated. Here, she connects with Lautner, but her love scenes with Pattinson are sterile and a little creepy (especially when one considers that (a) he's essentially an animated corpse, and (b) there's a 90-year age gap - this is an old dude who just happens to be well preserved). Readers of New Moon will know who Bella chooses and thus won't be surprised or disappointed. The same may not be true of those who approach the material fresh. Weitz does what amounts to a bait-and-switch. First rule of movie romances: never make the ""complications"" match more engaging than the ""real"" one. I also wonder whether Weitz realized how truly unlikeable Bella has become. Does he intend for viewers to despise her? 
 
 The storyline is all over the place, with numerous unresolved subplots sprouting out of thin air and being left hanging (presumably to be resolved in future movies). The lead male is around for the first 15 minutes and the final 30, but missing for the lengthy middle section. And, after the film has reached a natural stopping point, it continues for an additional ten minutes with a number of ""fake"" endings that eventually get us to what is supposed to be a cliffhanger. 
 
 If Twilight set back feminism by 50 years and vampires by twice that, New Moon turns its attention to shredding the werewolf mythos. Please don't let Stephanie Meyer near Frankenstein's creature! At least Bella develops a backbone during the course of New Moon and shows some spunk toward the end. Her prolonged period of lovesickness after Edward leaves her can be attributed to the fact that Meyer writes for 13-year old girls with the sensibility of a 13-year old girl. (Hence, the Bella/Edward relationship is all about romance and love and not at all about sex. The film is almost Victorian in the way it treats the interaction between the genders.) 
 
 There are some small pleasures to be found in New Moon, not the least of which is the relationship between Bella and Jacob. It's effectively developed and nicely played, and the revelation that Jacob is a werewolf doesn't come across as absurd as it could. We invest a little in these two being together. Stewart's acting - and she deserves some kind of award for keeping a straight face while delivering some of the ripest lines she has probably ever voiced - is in peak form while she's with Lautner. New Moon's extended middle act, despite being hurt by some really bad, B-movie type special effects, is by far its strongest portion. But don't get me started on the sheer stupidity of having vampires ""sparkle"" when exposed to sunlight rather than explode into flame. There are some rules that should not be re-written, and that's one of them. 
 
 New Moon offers no surprises, regardless of the perspective from which it is being evaluated. Fans will appreciate the way in which the text has been brought to the screen. Detractors and those with no interest will be unimpressed. The film does what it needs to do. That's the bottom line. Anyone who doesn't experience a tingling or surge of giddiness at the thought of another Twilight movie would be better off seeing something else. Those who mistakenly enter a theater playing New Moon without a previously cultivated love for the characters will either burst something from chortling at inappropriate moments or believe they have discovered a level of Hell that Dante never bothered to write about.

 “The Twilight Saga: New Moon,’’ the second installment in Hollywood’s adaptation of Stephenie Meyer’s mega-selling vampire romance series, is an anemic comedown after the full-blooded swoon of last year’s “Twilight.’’ Where the first film’s director, Catherine Hardwicke, plugged into Meyer’s vision of supernatural teenage lust with abandon, Chris Weitz is stuck with a sequel that’s a morning-after mope-fest. 
 
 The new movie has two things going for it: a relaxed and likable Taylor Lautner as Jacob Black, the newly buff Native American kid with a hairy secret and a crush on Bella (Kristen Stewart), and a wicked sense of humor about the story’s sexual subtext that doesn’t surface often enough. 
 
 In most other respects, the movie’s a drag - paced like a dirge and cursed with dialogue and a goopy musical score (Alexandre Desplat, how could you?) that bring out the book’s worst daytime soap tendencies. But what can you expect from an installment that keeps the central duo of human Bella and vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson) apart for an extended 500-page sulk? Even my impromptu focus group (two adolescent daughters and one friend) voted “New Moon’’ the least involving of the four books. 
 
 In the film, Edward leaves Bella after a birthday party goes horribly wrong - funny what a little paper cut can do to a room full of vampires. Stewart’s an actress of narrow abilities, to put it kindly, but in “Twilight,’’ she worked beautifully within her limits, lighting up with newly discovered love. In “New Moon,’’ she’s playing a spurned and devastated woman, and Stewart just doesn’t have the skill set to do much more than stare woodenly into the middle distance. 
 
 Just when you’re about to give up on her, Lautner’s Jacob appears on the scene, helping Bella rebuild a junkyard motorcycle. (Why? So she can drive recklessly and somehow make the spirit of Edward appear to her. Trust me, kids, this does not work in real life.) 
 
 The raging hype around “New Moon’’ has divided the planet between Team Edward and Team Jacob, and everyone’s forced to take sides. On the basis of the movie itself, it’s not much of a contest. When he’s onscreen, Pattinson’s Edward is all emo posturing under a trembling bouffant - the actor suddenly seems to be embarrassed to be here. Lautner’s performance, by contrast, has the warmth of an actual human. (And, yes, when he takes off his shirt to aide the wounded Bella, the crowd goes nuts.) 
 
 All right, there’s that little matter of Jacob being a werewolf - oops, did I spill the beans? This is taking the old Betty-and-Veronica dichotomy to new levels, and when “New Moon’’ breaks out the special effects, placing a frazzled Bella between wolfmen to the left of her and bloodsuckers to the right, the movie rouses itself to an enjoyable lunacy. 
 
 Other cast members lift the movie’s pulse above the standing level. Michael Sheen takes a break from playing historical figures like David Frost and Tony Blair and gets to overact shamelessly as Aro, the head of the vampire council known as the Volturi. Better yet, there’s Dakota Fanning, God bless her, showing Stewart how it’s done in one nifty scene as a vampirette with sadistic mental powers and old-school movie presence. 
 
 Anna Kendrick also walks away with her one scene as Bella’s tart high school pal, Jessica. (It’s a thankless role but no one will remember after the George Clooney drama “Up in the Air’’ comes out in a few weeks and Kendrick picks up a supporting actress Oscar nomination. You heard it here first.) Too bad the humans get short shrift in “New Moon,’’ taking a back seat to overcooked vampire-fu and supernatural Hatfield-vs-McCoy booshwah. 
 
 The “Twilight’’ books are all about sex, of course - about wanting it but not having it, and about the tension that comes steaming up from the cracks between. About boys who can ravage you but insist on protecting you from the beast within, even when you don’t want them to. About chastity and its discontents. Hardwicke got that; the first movie was about a shy nobody ennobled by a lust that dared not speak its name. 
 
 In “New Moon,’’ the stakes are both more obvious and sneakier. Bella wants to be bitten so badly, and why shouldn’t she when female vampires like Alice Cullen (Ashley Greene) and villainous Victoria (Rachelle Lefevre) are such self-confident hotties? Poor girl - when she gets on an airplane to rescue her lover, she’s stuck riding Virgin Air.

Some reviews: It’s “an anemic comedown after the full-blooded swoon of Twilight,” writes Ty Burr of the Boston Globe. Kristen Stewart is wooden as ever, and Robert Pattison “suddenly seems embarrassed to be here.” This is teenage love as imagined “by Madame Tussaud,” complains Roger Ebert. “The characters should be arrested for loitering with intent to moan.” Supposedly, this is an action-meets-romance flick. “So where’s the action?” asks Kyle Smith of the New York Post. “This movie moves like the line at the post office.” It’s awful all right, but fans won’t care, and for everyone else, it’s an unintentional comedy, writes James Berardinelli of ReelViews.

Any chemistry that may have existed between Kristen Stewart and Pattinson during Twilight has evaporated. Here, she connects with Lautner, but her love scenes with Pattinson are sterile and a little creepy (especially when one considers that (a) he\'s essentially an animated corpse, and (b) there\'s a 90-year age gap - this is an old dude who just happens to be well preserved). Readers of New Moon will know who Bella chooses and thus won\'t be surprised or disappointed. The same may not be true of those who approach the material fresh. Weitz does what amounts to a bait-and-switch. First rule of movie romances: never make the ""complications"" match more engaging than the ""real"" one. I also wonder whether Weitz realized how truly unlikeable Bella has become. Does he intend for viewers to despise her? \n \n The storyline is all over the place, with numerous unresolved subplots sprouting out of thin air and being left hanging (presumably to be resolved in future movies). The lead male is around for the first 15 minutes and the final 30, but missing for the lengthy middle section. And, after the film has reached a natural stopping point, it continues for an additional ten minutes with a number of ""fake"" endings that eventually get us to what is supposed to be a cliffhanger. \n \n If Twilight set back feminism by 50 years and vampires by twice that, New Moon turns its attention to shredding the werewolf mythos. Please don\'t let Stephanie Meyer near Frankenstein\'s creature! At least Bella develops a backbone during the course of New Moon and shows some spunk toward the end. Her prolonged period of lovesickness after Edward leaves her can be attributed to the fact that Meyer writes for 13-year old girls with the sensibility of a 13-year old girl. (Hence, the Bella/Edward relationship is all about romance and love and not at all about sex. The film is almost Victorian in the way it treats the interaction between the genders.) \n \n There are some small pleasures to be found in New Moon, not the least of which is the relationship between Bella and Jacob. It\'s effectively developed and nicely played, and the revelation that Jacob is a werewolf doesn\'t come across as absurd as it could. We invest a little in these two being together. Stewart\'s acting - and she deserves some kind of award for keeping a straight face while delivering some of the ripest lines she has probably ever voiced - is in peak form while she\'s with Lautner. New Moon\'s extended middle act, despite being hurt by some really bad, B-movie type special effects, is by far its strongest portion. But don\'t get me started on the sheer stupidity of having vampires ""sparkle"" when exposed to sunlight rather than explode into flame. There are some rules that should not be re-written, and that\'s one of them. \n \n New Moon offers no surprises, regardless of the perspective from which it is being evaluated. Fans will appreciate the way in which the text has been brought to the screen. Detractors and those with no interest will be unimpressed. The film does what it needs to do. That\'s the bottom line. Anyone who doesn\'t experience a tingling or surge of giddiness at the thought of another Twilight movie would be better off seeing something else. Those who mistakenly enter a theater playing New Moon without a previously cultivated love for the characters will either burst something from chortling at inappropriate moments or believe they have discovered a level of Hell that Dante never bothered to write about. \n \n Discuss this topic in the ReelViews Forums. ', ' Sorry, girls: The thrill is gone. \n \n “The Twilight Saga: New Moon,’’ the second installment in Hollywood’s adaptation of Stephenie Meyer’s mega-selling vampire romance series, is an anemic comedown after the full-blooded swoon of last year’s “Twilight.’’ Where the first film’s director, Catherine Hardwicke, plugged into Meyer’s vision of supernatural teenage lust with abandon, Chris Weitz is stuck with a sequel that’s a morning-after mope-fest. \n \n The new movie has two things going for it: a relaxed and likable Taylor Lautner as Jacob Black, the newly buff Native American kid with a hairy secret and a crush on Bella (Kristen Stewart), and a wicked sense of humor about the story’s sexual subtext that doesn’t surface often enough. \n \n In most other respects, the movie’s a drag - paced like a dirge and cursed with dialogue and a goopy musical score (Alexandre Desplat, how could you?) that bring out the book’s worst daytime soap tendencies. But what can you expect from an installment that keeps the central duo of human Bella and vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson) apart for an extended 500-page sulk? Even my impromptu focus group (two adolescent daughters and one friend) voted “New Moon’’ the least involving of the four books. \n \n In the film, Edward leaves Bella after a birthday party goes horribly wrong - funny what a little paper cut can do to a room full of vampires. Stewart’s an actress of narrow abilities, to put it kindly, but in “Twilight,’’ she worked beautifully within her limits, lighting up with newly discovered love. In “New Moon,’’ she’s playing a spurned and devastated woman, and Stewart just doesn’t have the skill set to do much more than stare woodenly into the middle distance. \n \n Just when you’re about to give up on her, Lautner’s Jacob appears on the scene, helping Bella rebuild a junkyard motorcycle. (Why? So she can drive recklessly and somehow make the spirit of Edward appear to her. Trust me, kids, this does not work in real life.) \n \n The raging hype around “New Moon’’ has divided the planet between Team Edward and Team Jacob, and everyone’s forced to take sides. On the basis of the movie itself, it’s not much of a contest. When he’s onscreen, Pattinson’s Edward is all emo posturing under a trembling bouffant - the actor suddenly seems to be embarrassed to be here. Lautner’s performance, by contrast, has the warmth of an actual human. (And, yes, when he takes off his shirt to aide the wounded Bella, the crowd goes nuts.) \n \n All right, there’s that little matter of Jacob being a werewolf - oops, did I spill the beans? This is taking the old Betty-and-Veronica dichotomy to new levels, and when “New Moon’’ breaks out the special effects, placing a frazzled Bella between wolfmen to the left of her and bloodsuckers to the right, the movie rouses itself to an enjoyable lunacy. \n \n Other cast members lift the movie’s pulse above the standing level. Michael Sheen takes a break from playing historical figures like David Frost and Tony Blair and gets to overact shamelessly as Aro, the head of the vampire council known as the Volturi. Better yet, there’s Dakota Fanning, God bless her, showing Stewart how it’s done in one nifty scene as a vampirette with sadistic mental powers and old-school movie presence. \n \n Anna Kendrick also walks away with her one scene as Bella’s tart high school pal, Jessica. (It’s a thankless role but no one will remember after the George Clooney drama “Up in the Air’’ comes out in a few weeks and Kendrick picks up a supporting actress Oscar nomination. You heard it here first.) Too bad the humans get short shrift in “New Moon,’’ taking a back seat to overcooked vampire-fu and supernatural Hatfield-vs-McCoy booshwah. \n \n The “Twilight’’ books are all about sex, of course - about wanting it but not having it, and about the tension that comes steaming up from the cracks between. About boys who can ravage you but insist on protecting you from the beast within, even when you don’t want them to. About chastity and its discontents. Hardwicke got that; the first movie was about a shy nobody ennobled by a lust that dared not speak its name. \n \n In “New Moon,’’ the stakes are both more obvious and sneakier. Bella wants to be bitten so badly, and why shouldn’t she when female vampires like Alice Cullen (Ashley Greene) and villainous Victoria (Rachelle Lefevre) are such self-confident hotties? Poor girl - when she gets on an airplane to rescue her lover, she’s stuck riding Virgin Air. \n \n © Copyright 2009 Globe Newspaper Company.']",3

 Authorities say Rex Whitmire Harbour staged his sniping attack Friday afternoon on the side of a highway outside Atlanta. He hit seven vehicles and shot two people. (Photo: Thinkstock) 
 
 GAINESVILLE, Ga. — A man accused of shooting at passing vehicles along a Georgia highway wrote that he idolized the suspect accused in the killing of 17 people at a high school in Florida, authorities said on Saturday. 
 
 The sniper, Rex Whitmire Harbour, 26, was identified Saturday afternoon during a news conference with the Hall County Sheriff's Office. After the terrifying shooting spree Friday afternoon, which injured two people and left at least seven vehicles with bullet holes, Harbour killed himself. 
 
 On Friday afternoon, Harbour perched himself on the side of Georgia 365, just outside Atlanta. Hiding in the wooded area made him harder to see, Hall County Sheriff Gerald Couch said. 
 
 He had with him an small arsenal of at least five guns and more than 3,000 rounds of ammunition, Couch said. 
 
 Harbour opened fire at passing vehicles driving northbound and hit at least seven. Two people — a 72-year-old man and a 54-year-old man — were shot. Another woman was injured due to broken glass after a bullet hit her windshield. Their names were not released. 
 
 The two men were hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries after being hit in the hip and leg. 
 
 The injured motorists called 911 about noon to report the shooting. Around that time, Couch said, authorities saw a suspicious vehicle pulling out of the woodline along the highway. 
 
 Troopers followed the vehicle and tried to make a traffic stop, but Harbour didn’t slow down, Couch said. 
 
 After a short chase, his vehicle came to a stop in the median of the highway. 
 
 Deputies and troopers approached the stopped vehicle and found Harbour with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. He was transported to a local hospital where he later died. 
 
 Authorities still don't have a motive but searched his home for clues. 
 
 Couch said investigators seized electronics and found ""disturbing"" hand-written documents that indicated Harbour ""idolized"" the Parkland shooting suspect Nikolas Cruz, who has been charged in the Valentine's Day killings of 17 people at a high school in Florida. 
 
 ""He called Nikolas Cruz a hero and that Cruz gave him courage and confidence,"" Couch said, adding, ""It appeared [Harbour] was targeting all Americans. Why? I don't know."" 
 
 Couch said that writings showed that Harbour had an overall hatred for everyone. As a result, he didn't target any specific ethnic group during his shooting spree on Friday, instead, apparently shooting at anyone who crossed his path. 
 
 Harbour lived with his parents in Snellville. 
 
 Detectives, speaking with his parents Friday night, learned that he was a landscaper, but, according to Couch, there was nothing within his employment history that specifically led him to Hall County or that particular stretch of highway. 
 
 An additional search of his background indicated there was no arrest history or any type of background of violence for Harbour. 
 
 Couch said he did not believe the weapons were stolen.

 A sheriff says 26-year-old landscaper Rex Whitmire Harbour of Snellville, fired at least 17 times and hit at least seven vehicles traveling northbound on Georgia 365 outside Atlanta around noon on Friday. Two people were wounded and a third was hurt by broken glass. None of their injuries were life-threatening. 
 
 Hall County Sheriff Gerald Couch told a news conference that a deputy chased after a suspicious car pulling out of a wooded area adjacent the highway on Friday. He said the suspect shot himself in the head, and his car rolled to a stop. Harbour later died at Grady Memorial Hospital. 
 
 Couch said investigators found three 9mm handguns, a 12-gauge shotgun, a BB-gun, and more than 3,400 rounds of ammunition inside his vehicle. Then they searched Harbour's home, where he lived with his parents, and found ""hate-filled"" handwritten documents. 
 
 WSB-TV Atlanta reported that the sheriff said Harbour's mother told investigators her son was mild-mannered and quiet. But the writings suggest he viewed Florida suspect Nikolas Cruz as a ""hero"" who gave him ""courage and confidence,"" the sheriff said. 
 
 ""What his motivation was other than just hate, we don't know at this time,"" Couch said. State investigators and the FBI turned up no criminal history. ""He had the weapons, the ammunition and obviously the will to inflict a lot of harm and a lot of hate."" ||||| 0 Victim of sniper-style attack says metal hip saved his life 
 
 HALL COUNTY, Ga. - For the first time, we're hearing from one of the victims shot in a sniper-style attack on a Hall County highway. 
 
 Harvey Kerby showed Channel 2's Matt Johnson the car he was driving in and he says he has a lot for which to be thankful for. 
 
 The bullet that hit him actually went through his car, in this area then right into his hip but his metal hip implant kept it from traveling any farther into his body. 
 
 The Hall County sheriff says Rex Harbour used a 9 mm pistol to shoot seven cars on Highway 365 near Whitehall Road. 
 
 Authorities say Harbour shot and killed himself after a short chase. 
 
 ""I was worried I was gonna bleed to death,"" Kerby said. 
 
 Kerby said a bullet traveled through his car door and through his seat belt before it landed in his hip as he drove. 
 
 ""If he would have shot a foot higher, it may have killed me,"" he said. 
 
 He was losing blood Friday morning but he was gaining an understanding of what had just happened right when a deputy showed up. 
 
 ""He kept saying, 'Did you see the car?' and I said, ""Oh no, he's shooting from the woods,'"" he said. ""I told the cop, 'There he goes, There he goes,' and he turned and saw it, and he saw it, and he hollered up the road to the SUV screaming, 'Here he goes! Here goes!' And they took off in the SUV after him.""

He liked who he saw, so he asked to go help me out in the kitchen."" \n \n She told him to get out because she didn\'t need help, but he kept on coming back and a romantic relationship ensued, Stumpf added. \n \n The two of them had three children together and had a difficult life when they moved to the United States, Stumpf said. \n \n ""We had little financial support, I didn\'t know anything and I could barely speak English,"" she said. ""We started arguing about every little thing."" \n \n After about 13 years of marriage, they divorced, Stumpf said. They eventually remarried, but both their second spouses have recently died. \n \n The two reconnected in December, Stumpf said, after her ""stubborn husband"" tried to get a hold of their daughter through and called the Walmart to rekindle a friendship. \n \n ""When we saw each other again last December, we knew right then we still loved each other for sure,"" Stumpf said. ""That love has never passed."" \n \n The two were thinking about doing the civil wedding today, and a church wedding later, Stumpf told ABC News, but they decided to wait a little and just enjoy each other\'s company for a bit. \n \n ""There\'s no rush at my age,"" Stumpf said. ""God put us together again, and it couldn\'t be any other way after all these years.""

 “You are going to write ‘Ian McKellen is decrepit. He can’t see, he can’t hear he can’t pee, he’s having his teeth done’,” he says with an impish glint in his eye. 
 
 The 73-year-old’s broad grin shows his hearty approach to the onset of old age. 
 
 But in his most candid interview, he reveals that along with his hearing problems and cataract, he also has prostate cancer. 
 
 The Lord of the Rings and X Men star is matter of fact about living with the disease. 
 
 “I’ve had prostate cancer for six or seven years,” he says. “When you have got it you monitor it and you have to be careful it doesn’t spread. But if it is contained in the prostate it’s no big deal. 
 
 “Many, many men die from it but it’s one of the cancers that is totally treatable so I have ‘waitful watching’. I am examined regularly and it’s just contained, it’s not spreading. I’ve not had any treatment.” Sir Ian is refreshingly honest about his condition, which is the sixth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in men. 
 
 He admits at first he feared the worst but now he happily lives with the disease, undergoing frequent check-ups. 
 
 © 2012 Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. Heroic: Sir Ian Gandalf the Grey 
 
 The star – looking tanned and healthy in his suite at Claridges ahead of tomorrow’s premiere of The Hobbit – admitted: “You do gulp when you hear the news. It’s like when you go for an HIV test, you go ‘arghhh is this the end of the road?’ 
 
 “They come and say you have cancer of the prostate and then they say you can have it zapped, you can have it snipped but you are not a candidate for that. You are waitful watching. 
 
 “I have heard of people dying from prostate cancer, and they are the unlucky ones, the people who didn’t know they had got it and it went on the rampage. But at my age if it is diagnosed its not life threatening.” 
 
 The actor realised something was wrong when he had to go to the toilet repeatedly in the night and decided to get himself checked out. 
 
 Despite his GP’s reluctance, a biopsy discovered cancerous cells. 
 
 “You are told what the situation is: you can have an operation but there is no point me having an operation because there is no need for it. 
 
 “What they are concerned about is the cancer going to spread outside the prostate? If it doesn’t you are fine. 
 
 “How do you know if it is spreading? You keep being tested.” 
 
 Crush: A young Ian McKellen 
 
 The veteran campaigner for gay rights has nothing but praise for the NHS which, he admits, he has been using rather a lot recently. When I say he is looking very fit and healthy for his age, and ask if he has felt the onset of his years, he pauses and appraises me with a Gandalf-like quizzical eye and addresses me with a tinge of his native Bolton accent. 
 
 “I just got hearing aids, I am going to have a cataract removed from my eyes, I am having an implant in my mouth, I am dealing with the prostate…I am absolutely fine thank you very much! 
 
 “I am lucky, I don’t have aches and pains. I do pilates regularly which is a series of stretching exercises and I recommend it to anyone of my age because the temptation is not to exercise when you get older. Well you should. 
 
 “I always walk up the escalator on the tube and I live in a house with a lot of stairs and that’s good exercise but you need more than that. 
 
 “The wonderful thing about modern medicine is that so many of these complaints that used to signify old age and decline can be coped with. 
 
 “I look at these little hearing aids I got, from the NHS, and I said how much would that cost if I went private and they said five or six thousand pounds. 
 
 “It is really, really wonderful that in your old age you are protected by specialists who understand your problems and sort them out for you. Well, isn’t that what we all need?” 
 
 Work, today, is promoting his return as Gandalf the wizard in The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. Set before The Lord of the Rings, it tells of how hobbit Bilbo Baggins sets off on an adventure with a band of dwarves to steal back a hoard of gold guarded by a dragon. 
 
 ITV Dream come true: On Corrie 
 
 The production, which will see two more films released, was mired in delays and the veteran actor, who became a worldwide star for his performance as the wizard in the Rings trilogy, nearly decided not to play him again. 
 
 He said: “I was in two minds about it. So I made a mental list of the pros and cons. Cons included do I want to live in New Zealand for 18 months? I love it but do I want to go there for that long? And at my age, do I want to go back to a part I’ve already played when I could be doing something else? 
 
 “The film was on and off for so long, more than two years. I was adjusting to the fact it might not happen. Then finally they said they were going to make it and I thought ‘oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.’ 
 
 “An actress friend said to me ‘all the kids are not going to worry about you going away to New Zealand, they just want you to do the film. You are going to have to do it for them. And I thought oh yes of course.” 
 
 A mischievous grin plays across his face again: “Plus the fact, which was there all along, I didn’t want anyone else to play Gandalf. It’s mine,” he roars. 
 
 Sir Ian rattles off a long list of jobs coming up to keep him busy. After fulfilling a life-long wish to appear in Coronation Street, he has just started rehearsals for his first sitcom, with Sir Derek Jacobi, where they playing a bickering elderly gay couple. 
 
 The pair are pals from university, and Sir Ian admits he fell for his friend. 
 
 “He denies having a crush on me but I certainly had a crush on him. He was a very attractive young man. If things had been different maybe we would be the couple in the sitcom.” 
 
 But another role has been filling his time, that of publican. Along with former partner, theatre director Sean Mathias, he has taken over the historic Grapes pub near home in Limehouse, East London. 
 
 But dealing with prima donna Hollywood stars and directors with volcanic tempers did nothing to prepare him dealing with…chefs. 
 
 “We have a manager in but I get to hear about the problems. Thank god I don’t have to deal with them. 
 
 “We’ve had some hair raising tales. Chefs are worse than any other group, from temperamental actors to directors. It’s as if they’ve all been watching reruns of Gordon Ramsay. F**k this, f**k that. 
 
 “But the pub is a delight.” 
 
 So expect to see this grand knight of the stage and screen in his next great role, pulling a pint. ||||| Dave Kotinsky/Getty Images 
 
 A report that Sir Ian McKellen has had prostate cancer for the past six or seven years has been denied by the actor's agent, who said that McKellen is in fine health. 
 
 Chris Andrews told ABCNews.com today that the actor, 73, does not have prostate cancer, as reported by the U.K. tabloid The Sun. 
 
 ""No, he does not have prostate cancer. … That was taken out of context and from an interview from years ago,"" Andrews said. 
 
 Andrews pointed to McKellen's appearance at the premiere of ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" in New Zealand on Nov. 28 as evidence of the actor's health. 
 
 CLD Communications, which represents McKellen in the U.K., also confirmed that the story ""was taken out of context."" 
 
 The Sun had quoted McKellen as saying, ""You do gulp when you hear the news. … It's like when you go for an HIV test - you go 'Argh, is this the end of the road?' You monitor it and you have to be careful it doesn't spread."" 
 
 McKellen is expected to attend the premiere of ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" Wednesday night in London's Leicester Square.","– Gossip outlets were abuzz this week with the news that Ian McKellen, aka Gandalf and/or Magneto, has prostate cancer—but now his agent says that isn't so.

But if it is contained in the prostate it’s no big deal. \n \n “Many, many men die from it but it’s one of the cancers that is totally treatable so I have ‘waitful watching’. I am examined regularly and it’s just contained, it’s not spreading. I’ve not had any treatment.” Sir Ian is refreshingly honest about his condition, which is the sixth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in men. \n \n He admits at first he feared the worst but now he happily lives with the disease, undergoing frequent check-ups. \n \n © 2012 Warner Bros.

You are waitful watching. \n \n “I have heard of people dying from prostate cancer, and they are the unlucky ones, the people who didn’t know they had got it and it went on the rampage. But at my age if it is diagnosed its not life threatening.” \n \n The actor realised something was wrong when he had to go to the toilet repeatedly in the night and decided to get himself checked out. \n \n Despite his GP’s reluctance, a biopsy discovered cancerous cells. \n \n “You are told what the situation is: you can have an operation but there is no point me having an operation because there is no need for it. \n \n “What they are concerned about is the cancer going to spread outside the prostate? If it doesn’t you are fine. \n \n “How do you know if it is spreading? You keep being tested.” \n \n Crush: A young Ian McKellen \n \n The veteran campaigner for gay rights has nothing but praise for the NHS which, he admits, he has been using rather a lot recently. When I say he is looking very fit and healthy for his age, and ask if he has felt the onset of his years, he pauses and appraises me with a Gandalf-like quizzical eye and addresses me with a tinge of his native Bolton accent. \n \n “I just got hearing aids, I am going to have a cataract removed from my eyes, I am having an implant in my mouth, I am dealing with the prostate…I am absolutely fine thank you very much! \n \n “I am lucky, I don’t have aches and pains.

Well you should. \n \n “I always walk up the escalator on the tube and I live in a house with a lot of stairs and that’s good exercise but you need more than that. \n \n “The wonderful thing about modern medicine is that so many of these complaints that used to signify old age and decline can be coped with. \n \n “I look at these little hearing aids I got, from the NHS, and I said how much would that cost if I went private and they said five or six thousand pounds. \n \n “It is really, really wonderful that in your old age you are protected by specialists who understand your problems and sort them out for you. Well, isn’t that what we all need?” \n \n Work, today, is promoting his return as Gandalf the wizard in The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey.

So I made a mental list of the pros and cons. Cons included do I want to live in New Zealand for 18 months? I love it but do I want to go there for that long? And at my age, do I want to go back to a part I’ve already played when I could be doing something else? \n \n “The film was on and off for so long, more than two years. I was adjusting to the fact it might not happen. Then finally they said they were going to make it and I thought ‘oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.’ \n \n “An actress friend said to me ‘all the kids are not going to worry about you going away to New Zealand, they just want you to do the film. You are going to have to do it for them. And I thought oh yes of course.” \n \n A mischievous grin plays across his face again: “Plus the fact, which was there all along, I didn’t want anyone else to play Gandalf. It’s mine,” he roars. \n \n Sir Ian rattles off a long list of jobs coming up to keep him busy. After fulfilling a life-long wish to appear in Coronation Street, he has just started rehearsals for his first sitcom, with Sir Derek Jacobi, where they playing a bickering elderly gay couple. \n \n The pair are pals from university, and Sir Ian admits he fell for his friend. \n \n “He denies having a crush on me but I certainly had a crush on him. He was a very attractive young man. If things had been different maybe we would be the couple in the sitcom.” \n \n But another role has been filling his time, that of publican. Along with former partner, theatre director Sean Mathias, he has taken over the historic Grapes pub near home in Limehouse, East London. \n \n But dealing with prima donna Hollywood stars and directors with volcanic tempers did nothing to prepare him dealing with…chefs. \n \n “We have a manager in but I get to hear about the problems. Thank god I don’t have to deal with them. \n \n “We’ve had some hair raising tales. Chefs are worse than any other group, from temperamental actors to directors. It’s as if they’ve all been watching reruns of Gordon Ramsay.

"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Barack Obama opens up about how he felt after Donald Trump's inauguration 
 
 Former US President Barack Obama has warned against the irresponsible use of social media, in a rare interview since stepping down in January. 
 
 He warned that such actions were distorting people's understanding of complex issues, and spreading misinformation. 
 
 ""All of us in leadership have to find ways in which we can recreate a common space on the internet,"" he said. 
 
 Mr Obama was quizzed by Prince Harry on BBC Radio 4's Today programme. 
 
 Prince Harry, fifth in line to the throne, is one of several prominent figures who are guest-editing the programme over the Christmas period. 
 
 Obama on the extremes of social media 
 
 The former president expressed concern about a future where facts are discarded and people only read and listen to things that reinforce their own views. 
 
 ""One of the dangers of the internet is that people can have entirely different realities. They can be cocooned in information that reinforces their current biases. 
 
 ""The question has to do with how do we harness this technology in a way that allows a multiplicity of voices, allows a diversity of views, but doesn't lead to a Balkanisation of society and allows ways of finding common ground,"" he said. 
 
 Mr Obama's successor Donald Trump is a prolific user of Twitter, but Mr Obama did not mention him by name. 
 
 Mr Trump has been accused of overusing Twitter and following only a narrow range of users, though he maintains it allows him to connect directly with the American people. 
 
 Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Boxers or briefs? Prince Harry grills Barack Obama on his likes and dislikes 
 
 Mr Obama suggested face-to-face contact would help counteract extreme views. 
 
 ""Social media is a really powerful tool for people of common interests to convene and get to know each other and connect. 
 
 ""But then it's important for them to get offline, meet in a pub, meet at a place of worship, meet in a neighbourhood and get to know each other. 
 
 ""Because the truth is that on the internet, everything is simplified and when you meet people face-to-face it turns out they're complicated."" 
 
 What were the pressures of being president? 
 
 ""It's hard, being in the public eye is unpleasant in a lot of ways. It is challenging in a lot of ways. 
 
 ""Your loved ones are made vulnerable in ways that might not have been true 20 years ago or 30 years ago. 
 
 ""So it is a sacrifice that I think everybody has to be at peace with when they decide to go into politics. But, ultimately, I think the rewards of bringing about positive change in this world make it worthwhile."" 
 
 Mr Obama pays tribute to the support of his family, especially his wife Michelle, describing how glad he is that she was ""my partner throughout that whole process"". 
 
 And leaving office? 
 
 Mixed feelings given ""all the work that was still undone"". 
 
 ""Concerns about how the country moves forward but, you know, overall there was serenity there,"" he added. 
 
 Mr Obama compared his time in office to being a relay runner. 
 
 Image copyright AFP Image caption ""Serenity"" on leaving office - Obama's last White House press conference in January 
 
 ""If you ran hard, you did your best and you were able to pass that baton successfully and the world was a little better then you had done your job."" 
 
 He cites Obamacare - ensuring more people can afford basic healthcare - as a major achievement. 
 
 ""What an enormous blessing it is to say that 20 million Americans have health insurance that didn't have it before."" 
 
 How does he see the future? 
 
 Without dismissing the problems faced by the world, he remains an optimist. 
 
 ""If we take responsibility for being involved in our own fate, if we participate, if we engage, if we speak out, if we work in our communities, if we volunteer, then all the problems that we face are solvable despite all the terrible news that you see. 
 
 ""If you had to choose a moment in human history in which you'd want to be born you'd choose today because the fact is that the world is healthier, wealthier, better educated and more tolerant, more sophisticated and less violent."" 
 
 What does Prince Harry have to say? 
 
 As well as editing, Prince Harry was himself interviewed on Today. 
 
 ""I haven't done that many interviews but it was quite fun, especially interviewing President Obama despite the fact he wanted to interview me. 
 
 ""It's been a big learning curve but also these are incredibly important topics we all need to think about and need to be discussed."" 
 
 The prince's programme focused on issues such as the armed forces, mental health, youth crime and climate change. ||||| Prince Harry definitely knows how to handle a difficult question. 
 
 The prince bagged former U.S. President Barack Obama's first interview since leaving office, during his stint as guest editor of BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Wednesday.

 LONDON (AP) — Former President Barack Obama told Prince Harry in an interview broadcast Wednesday that he felt serene the day he left the White House despite the sense that much important work remained unfinished. 
 
 Obama said it was ""hugely liberating"" to be able to set his own agenda in the morning and to have the time to talk with his wife, Michelle, now that he is no longer president. 
 
 He spoke with Harry in the prince's capacity as guest editor of the BBC Radio 4 news program. Both men said the interview, recorded in Canada in September, was Obama's first since leaving the presidency in January. 
 
 ""I miss the work itself because it was fascinating,"" Obama said of his eight years in the Oval Office, citing his health care reforms as one of his proudest achievements. 
 
 He did not mention his successor, President Donald Trump, but did say people in government should be careful in their use of social media. 
 
 In his guest editing slot, Harry also focused on climate change, the military and mental health. 
 
 He used his position to ask Obama a ""lightning round"" of questions of the type normally asked of entertainers, not politicians. 
 
 The former president declined to say whether he wears boxers or briefs, but was willing to say he prefers Aretha Franklin to Tina Turner — ""Aretha is the best,"" he said of the Queen of Soul — and favors retired basketball star Michael Jordan over current star LeBron James. 
 
 Obama also said he is ""obsessed"" with helping to train the next generation of leaders and said the world is in many ways healthier and wealthier than it has ever been. 
 
 Harry also interviewed his father, Prince Charles, who offered more gloomy assessment. He said the root causes of climate change are not being addressed even as it leads to more destruction in many parts of the world. 
 
 At the end of the show, Harry would not say whether Obama will be invited to his May wedding to American actress Meghan Markle, saying the guest list hadn't been drawn up yet. But he did say Markle had enjoyed her first Christmas as a guest of Queen Elizabeth II at her country estate.

"Abstract 
 
 Research has found that the appearance of women’s apparel helps increase their attractiveness as rated by men and that men care more about physical features in potential opposite-sex mates. However, the effect of sartorial appearance has received little interest from scientists. In a series of studies, the length of women’s shoe heels was examined. A woman confederate wearing black shoes with 0, 5, or 9 cm heels asked men for help in various circumstances. In Study 1, she asked men to respond to a short survey on gender equality. In Study 2, the confederate asked men and women to participate in a survey on local food habit consumption. In Study 3, men and women in the street were observed while walking in back of the female confederate who dropped a glove apparently unaware of her loss. It was found that men’s helping behavior increased as soon as heel length increased. However, heel length had no effect on women’s helping behavior. It was also found that men spontaneously approached women more quickly when they wore high-heeled shoes (Study 4). Change in gait, foot-size judgment, and misattribution of sexiness and sexual intent were used as possible explanations. ||||| New research suggests wearing heels forces women to walk in a way that exaggerates their femininity. 
 
 • 
 
 Fashions in dress come and go, but a peculiar one has stayed in style for many generations, and shows no sign of fading away. It’s the high-heeled shoe, which first became a fashion statement in 16th-century France, and has been a part of the modern woman’s wardrobe since the mid-19th century. 
 
 Ask a woman why she endures the awkwardness and discomfort, and she’ll probably respond, “They make me look, and feel, more attractive.” Newly published research suggests this perception is accurate, but perhaps not for the reason you’d expect. 
 
 It’s not the artificially increased height that turns heads. Rather, it’s how such footwear changes the mechanics of a woman’s gait. 
 
 “High heels may exaggerate the sex-specific aspects of the female walk,” a University of Portsmouth research team led by psychologist Paul Morris reports in the journal Evolution and Human Behavior. While noting that preference in footwear is based in part on culture norms, they argue the enduring popularity of high-heeled shoes suggest their fundamental appeal stems from a deeper impulse. 
 
 To test whether walking in high heels increases one’s femininity and attractiveness, Morris and his colleagues conducted two experiments using a point-light display. Participants (15 men and 15 women) viewed dotted outlines of 12 women as they walked for a total of four minutes apiece—two minutes in high-heeled shoes, and two minutes wearing flats. 
 
 They were then asked to rate how attractive they found the figures. 
 
 “For all walkers, the attractiveness score was higher in the heels condition than in the flat condition,” the researchers report. Both males and females judged the women wearing high heels to be more attractive than those who wore flat shoes. 
 
 In the second experiment, 120 participants (82 women and 38 men) watched the same dotted-outline footage and were asked to judge whether each of the models was male or female. (As noted earlier, all were, in fact, women.) While wearing flats, 28 percent of the women were incorrectly classified as men; among wearing heels, that number went down to 17 percent. 
 
 Why? The researchers report that, while wearing high-heeled shoes, the women “walked in a fashion more characteristic of female gait.” Specifically, “walkers in high heels took smaller, more frequent steps,” and this reduction in the length of their stride was accompanied by “increased rotation and tilt of the hips.” 
 
 In other words, they argue, high heels exaggerate the differences in the ways men and women walk, making the wearer appear more feminine. This stimulates “sexual arousal in males,” as well as increased attentiveness on the part of women who are scoping out potential competitors for male attention. 
 
 This can happen on either a conscious or an unconscious level, but this evidence suggests the dynamic is real, and transcends fashion fads. 
 
 Morris and his colleagues conclude that a woman walking in high heels is a “supernormal stimulus”—that is, an enhanced version of a stimulus found in nature. Previous research has suggested junk food can be seen the same way, in that it stimulates our natural craving for sugar, salt and fats by offering them in exaggerated concentrations. 
 
 So to sum up: High heels have a lot in common with Ho Hos. We may view them with ambivalence or concern, but in spite of ourselves, we feel the primal pull they exert. And we’re not likely to break our addiction any time soon. ||||| TIME Health For more, visit TIME Health 
 
 Cue a collective sigh from women everywhere: a new study in the journal Archives of Sexual Behavior proves that men really do find women in high heels significantly sexier. 
 
 Study author Nicholas Gueguen in the department of social behavior at the University of Bretagne conducted three experiments using French women identically dressed in black suits with straight skirts and white shirts. Most were also all brunettes: because previous studies showed that men were more likely to approach blonde women over brunettes and ask them out on dates. The only differences between the women were their shoes. 
 
 In the series of experiments, Gueguen dangled the women as science bait in front of unsuspecting men. 
 
 First, the women—wearing either black flats with no heel, black shoes with a 2 inch heel or black pumps with a 3.5 inch heel—approached several people and asked them for assistance. The woman switched shoes after soliciting every 10 people.

 When a 19-year-old woman approached men between ages 25 and 50, asking for their help with a survey on gender equality, she garnered the most responses when she wore the highest heels—83% of the men she approached agreed to spend three to four minutes answering her questions, compared to nearly half as many, 47%, when she wore flat shoes. Not terribly surprising. 
 
 But would women react the same way to fellow sisters in high heels? To find out, four women asked both men and women to participate in a food survey about what they ate. Again, men were more likely to respond when the women wore higher heels—82% agreed to do the survey when the women wore 3.5 inch heels, compared to 42% who did when they wore flats. But ladies didn’t fall for it. Only about 33% of women on average said yes to the survey request, regardless of the heel height. 
 
 Why were men more receptive to the women in high heels? To test the obvious attraction hypothesis, Gueguen told the women to find “marks” and walk ahead of them, then drop a glove. A whopping 93% of men chased after the women when they wore high heels to return the glove, compared to 62% of those who did when she wore flat shoes. And while women were also more likely to track down the high-heeled women than those wearing flats, the rates were much lower—52% for the heel wearers and 43% for the flats wearers.

 For the grand finale, researchers wanted to see if high heels could actually make men more likely to pursue the wearers as mates. They strategically placed women wearing different heel heights in three bars, seating them at tables near the bar where their shoes were visible to those standing at the counter and perusing the field. On average, it took men only 7.49 minutes to approach women wearing the high heels. For those wearing flat shoes, it took nearly twice as long—13.54 minutes. 
 
 All of this confirms that men tend to use physical attributes as a way to gauge women’s attractiveness and to find potential mates. It’s not exactly a revelation; Gueguen found in a previous study that female hitchhikers with bigger breasts get picked up more often by male drivers. But now, science gives some credibility to the seemingly illogical (and unhealthy) choice to endure pinched toes and vertiginous heights. “As a man I can see that I prefer to see my wife when she wears high heels and many men in France have the same evaluation,” Gueguen writes in an email response.

 What exactly is so sexy about high heels? Gueguen blames (or credits) the media for its strong imagery association between stilettos and sexiness. And yes, higher heels can change the way a woman walks, making her hips sway a bit more as she negotiates walking at a more precarious height, but in the study, even women who were seated and wearing heels were approached by more men. And Gueguen’s follow-up studies, in which he showed men photos of women wearing heels or flats, confirmed that there was more to the attraction than a woman’s gait. “The results showed that high heels were associated with greater sexiness, overall physical attractiveness, breast attractiveness, beauty, attractiveness to other men, and willingness for a date,” he writes. Now, whether you want to be approached or left blissfully alone, there’s a shoe height for that.","– From the researcher who showed female hitchhikers with big breasts got picked up more by men than their flatter-chested counterparts comes another revealing study: one that appears to confirm that guys think high heels are sexier than flats. In a report published in the Archives of Sexual Behavior, the University of Bretagne's Nicolas Gueguen carried out a set of experiments by putting brown-haired French women—Time mentions that past studies have shown blondes are approached more than brunettes—in a series of scenarios, wearing three different types of shoes: black flats, black shoes with a 2-inch heel, or black pumps with a 3.5-inch heel. In the first experiment, as broken down by Time, a woman wearing the highest heel was able to get 83% of men ages 25 to 50 to help her with a gender equality survey; only 47% of the guys helped her when she wore flats. To test how both men and women responded, four testers in the second experiment asked subjects to help them with a food survey; 82% of men helped the high-heelers, 42% the flats-wearers, while only 33% of women subjects helped out, no matter what the heel height. To test attractiveness levels, the testers then walked in front of ""marks"" and dropped gloves—93% of men retrieved the glove for high-heel wearers, 62% for those in flats. And testers sitting at a bar? It only took men about 7.49 minutes to approach those in high heels, while those in flats had to wait nearly 14 minutes. Gueguen attributes the sexiness of high heels to media imagery, among other reasons, as well as how it changes a woman's gait. ""High heels may exaggerate the sex-specific aspects of the female walk,"" a researcher said last year in the Pacific Standard. (Some women have surgery so their high heels fit better.)","['Abstract \n \n Research has found that the appearance of women’s apparel helps increase their attractiveness as rated by men and that men care more about physical features in potential opposite-sex mates.

"This weekend marks President Donald Trump’s third straight at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. | Getty White House reverses on Trump's golf game 
 
 President Donald Trump played a full round of golf Sunday, enjoying once again a habit he regularly assailed Barack Obama for. After initially saying Trump had only played a few holes, the White House reversed itself Monday after professional golfer Rory McIlroy posted on his website that he had played 18 holes with the president. 
 
 “As stated yesterday the President played golf. He intended to play a few holes and decided to play longer,” White House spokesperson Sarah Sanders said Monday. “He also had a full day of meetings, calls and interviews for the new NSA, which he is continuing today before returning to Washington, D.C. tonight.”

 This weekend marks Trump’s third straight at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, which he has taken to calling the “Winter White House.” 
 
 Trump regularly panned Obama for his penchant for hitting the links, but Trump made it to the golf course far faster than the previous two presidents, waiting just two weeks before playing his first round. Trump recently golfed with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, and is expected to conduct more such golf diplomacy. 
 
 ||||| Donald Trump took to the golf course on Sunday. Jeff J Mitchell / Getty Images News Four-time major champion Rory McIlroy played golf with Donald Trump at Trump International, Florida, on Sunday and has revealed that the president of the United States returned a score of ""around 80."" 
 
 A photograph of Trump and McIlroy with Clear Sports CEO Garry Singer and former Yankees right fielder Paul O'Neill went viral recently but the four-ball that took to the field consisted of Trump, world No.3 Rory Mac, ISM agent Nick Mullen, and Trump friend Rich Levine. 
 
 According to No Laying Up, McIlroy claimed he was not informed of the grouping until Saturday night and, though a rib injury had been delaying his plans to return to a course, he could not turn Trump's invitation down. 
 
 McIlroy said: ""[Trump] probably shot around 80. He's a decent player for a guy in his 70s!"" 
 
 Holywood hotshot McIlroy has not played competitive golf since losing a playoff to Graeme Storm in the South African Open in January. 
 
 There are rumours he could make his comeback from injury on March 2 when the WGC-Mexico Championship tees off at the Club de Golf Chapultepec in Naucalpan, Mexico. 
 
 Other professional golfers to wax lyrical over Trump's golfing include Tiger Woods who, in December, noted on his official blog that: ""what [is] most impressive was how far Trump hits the ball at 70-years-old. He takes a pretty good lash."" 
 
 Trump has also played with ""The Big Easy"" Ernie Els and LPGA tour star Lexi Thompson. ||||| Donald Trump hit the links for the second straight week last Sunday, news that came as a surprise to the White House Press Pool. After Clear Sports tweeted this picture of its CEO alongside President Trump, World No. 3 Rory McIlroy and Yankees legend Paul O’Neill…

 …NoLayingUp.com confirmed the news with Rory. 
 
 “He probably shot around 80. He’s a decent player for a guy in his 70’s!” 
 
 A Trump spokesperson confirmed the report itself a few hours later, saying he had originally only intended to play a few holes. 
 
 Because President Trump is a divisive figure among so many, that led to something of a social media backlash for Rory McIlroy. The responses were varied — many golf fans had no issue with Rory playing golf with the President — but there were a large number who did. A sampling of the negative comments:

 Golf columnist Lawrence Donegan was especially vocal in a radio segment that day: 
 
 “The problem is that Rory is a beloved figure, probably the most beloved figure in his sport,” he said. “He is apparently appealing to a younger audience, he is very vocal about appealing to a younger audience. It basically reinforces old stereotypes.” 
 
 “I literally can’t believe that McIlroy has done this,” he continued. 
 
 Piers Morgan was the highest-profile figure to come to his defense:

 Some people are always going on about how much they love chocolate, that it’s so good they want it injected directly into their blood stream. “Give me a hit of that sweet, sweet chocolate!” they scream. 
 
 So when I learned from the Washington Post today that snortable chocolate is a thing now, I didn’t bat an eye. My first thought was: of course, I know this, I’ve alway known this. My second: wait, should I have already been doing this?

 The team behind Coco Loko, a chocolatey powder being peddled as a drug-free stimulant for $12.50 a bottle (they sell more than 40,000 of these per month!), would have you believe that snorting chocolate is a novel idea. Coco Loko’s Orlando-based parent company, Legal Lean—which sounds like an illegal weight-loss brand—claims the product contains cacao powder as well as ingredients commonly found in energy drinks, such as gingko biloba, taurine and guarana. Legal Lean’s founder is 29-year-old Nick Anderson, who told the Post that he first heard about the “chocolate-snorting trend” in Europe a few months ago. Now Anderson is convinced that snortable chocolate “is the future.” 
 
 In fact, snortable chocolate has been kicking around Europe for at least a couple years. In 2015 a Belgian chocolatier was selling a device that shoots two small bumps of cocoa powder up your nose for you. These chocolate snorting kits cost $109 a pop. 
 
 Also, given how passionate people are about chocolate and sticking substances up their noses, I’m sure it’s been tried since long before any of us were born. It only wasn’t until very recently that you could pay too much money for the experience of sticking chocolate up your nose. And maybe in the future it truly will be socially acceptable to emerge from a club bathroom with brown stuff all over your nose. I kind of doubt it, but I’m willing to be wrong. ||||| You may have seen stories about people snorting chocolate on your social media timelines. 
 
 The stories led to chatter in the ABC10 newsroom about whether or not ""snortable"" chocolate was a real product in the U.S. 
 
 So, ABC10 set out to verify if chocolate powder for the nose could be found at a store near you. 
 
 It turns out, a product called Coco Loko was launched in the U.S. about two weeks ago by a company called Legal Lean, according to Nick Anderson, owner of the business. 
 
 Coko Loco is ""infused raw cacao snuff."" Essentially, it's just cacao powder infused with energy boosters such as guarana and taurine, and a couple other natural cacao enhancers. The product looks like hot cocoa powder or chocolate milk powder and is intended to be ingested through the nose. 
 
 The Orlando-based company claims, Coco Loko results in an endorphin rush which mimics a ""runner's high"" and can also produce a euphoric energy ""similar to the feeling of ecstasy."" The product is marketed to people looking to party and who want an extra shot of energy. The company even claims athletes use the powder to obtain a ""natural competitive edge."" 
 
 Anderson explained, Coco Loko gives the rush of eating a candy bar or a piece of chocolate cake, without the sugar crash.

 Snorting cocoa or cacao powder isn't a new trend. It's been a popular ""drug"" choice in European clubs for years. 
 
 ""We wanted to create a new product that's marketable,"" Anderson said. 
 
 Retailers, such as WalMart, Target and Amazon, already sell raw cacao in the U.S. Cacao is the purest form of chocolate and is considered a superfood for being high in antioxidants. It is not the same thing as cocoa, which is processed at higher heat. 
 
 Coco Loko is the first cacao powder product to be sold in the U.S. specifically for the use of snorting. 
 
 So why can't you just buy cacao powder at a retail store and ingest it through your nose? Why is Coco Loko any different? 
 
 It's not. 
 
 ""We're marketing to a niche market that wants convenience,"" Anderson said. ""We want to make it the cool thing."" 
 
 Anderson explained, Coco Loko is sold in small, 1.25 ounce jars that are designed to pop into a person's pocket. This way, if a person wants to use it while out in a club, they can do so easily. 
 
 The reason for snorting the product is to feel the effects immediately, according to Anderson. Coco Loko can be mixed with milk or a beverage but it takes longer to feel the effects, which isn't convenient for the person out and about looking for some fun. 
 
 ""I could see all demographics buying it but younger people are usually more open to trying it than older people,"" Anderson said. 
 
 Although Coco Loko is intended to snort while out partying, similar to drugs such as cocaine and MDMA, better known as Molly, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) doesn't regulate the cacao powder. 
 
 In fact, DEA spokesperson, Casey Rettig, told ABC10 she'd never heard of the product. The DEA only regulates products which contain Schedule I through V drugs. Cacao powder is not on any of the lists. 
 
 ABC10 also reached out to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), who released this statement: 
 
 ""The FDA is not prepared to issue a determination regarding whether and how this product is subject to FDA jurisdiction at this time."" said Peter Cassell, FDA spokesperson. ""In reaching that decision, FDA will need to evaluate the product labeling, marketing information, and/or any other information pertaining to the product’s intended use."" 
 
 While Coco Loko is a legal product, it's not being regulated by the government and there are no current studies on the effects of snorting the cacao powder. 
 
 ""We don't know what it does to the nose,"" said Dr. Toby Steele, ENT-otolaryngologist with University of California, Davis. 
 
 Steele explained, in general, anything going up the nose other than nasal saline can damage mucus membranes, which help trap bacteria and other harmful particles entering the nose. 
 
 The nose could also become irritated or experience blockage. 
 
 ""What I would worry about the most is loss of sense of smell,"" Steele said. 
 
 Losing the sense of smell could be potentially dangerous since it serves as a warning in certain situations such as a fire or natural gas leak. 
 
 Steele doesn't recommend ingesting the cacao powder product through the nose. 
 
 ""If a patient asked me if they should do it, I'd say no,"" Steele said. 
 
 Coco Loko isn't available in California stores yet. Anderson didn't have a date for when the product will hit California shelves but said it'd be ""very soon."" 
 
 However, the product is sold online for $24.99/1.25 oz. jar and is currently on sale for $19.99.

 Now meet Coco Loko, a “snortable” chocolate powder being marketed as a drug-free way to get a buzz. The product, created by Orlando-based company Legal Lean, includes cacao powder, as well as gingko biloba, taurine and guarana, which are commonly found in energy drinks. 
 
 Nick Anderson, the 29-year-old founder of Legal Lean, says he heard about a “chocolate-snorting trend” in Europe a few months ago. He ordered a sample and gave it a try. 
 
 “At first, I was like, ‘Is this a hoax?,'” he recalled. “And then I tried it and it was like, okay, this is the future right here.” 
 
 Each tin of Coco Loko comes with 10 servings and costs $24.99. (Courtesy of Legal Lean) 
 
 That led him to invest $10,000 into creating his own “raw cacao snuff.” It took about 10 tries over two months to come up with the mixture, which was created by an Orlando-based supplement company. 
 
 “Some versions, they just burned too much,” Anderson said. “Other times they looked gray and dull, or didn’t have enough stimulants.” 
 
 The effects of the cacao-based powder, he said, last about 30 minutes to an hour, and are “almost like an energy-drink feeling, like you’re euphoric but also motivated to get things done.” 
 
 But doctors say they’re not quite sure what to make of the brown powder, which hit U.S. shelves last month and is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. 
 
 “The question is, what are the risks of doing it?” said Dr. Andrew Lane, director of the Johns Hopkins Sinus Center. “There’s no data, and as far as I can tell, no one’s studied what happens if you inhale chocolate into your nose. When I mention it to people, nobody’s ever heard of it.” (“Maybe,” he added, “I’m not in the in-crowd.”) 
 
 Lane said he wasn’t particularly worried that “snortable” chocolate could become a gateway drug, as users become accustomed to getting a buzz by inhaling powders. 
 
 “If you’re going to do drugs, you probably don’t start with chocolate,” he said. “Certainly this is better than using an illicit drug.” 
 
 The medical community has long raised concerns about the health effects of energy drinks — which often rely on caffeine, taurine and guarana, and have been shown to raise blood pressure and cause heart palpitations. Lane says those effects could be magnified if a person inhales those stimulants. 
 
 [FDA report describing deaths sheds light on high-caffeine beverages] 
 
 “There are a few obvious concerns,” he said. “First, it’s not clear how much of each ingredient would be absorbed into the nasal mucus membranes. And, well, putting solid material into your nose — you could imagine it getting stuck in there, or the chocolate mixing with your mucus to create a paste that could block your sinuses.” 
 
 A spokesman for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it had not decided whether, or how, the agency would regulate the product. 
 
 “In reaching that decision, FDA will need to evaluate the product labeling, marketing information, and/or any other information pertaining to the product’s intended use,” spokesman Peter Cassell said in an email. 
 
 A representative for the Drug Enforcement Administration, meanwhile, said he was not aware of any agency concerns related to chocolate inhalants. 
 
 Tins of Coco Loko, which have about 10 servings, sell for $24.99. Anderson, whose brother is a rapper named Bezz Believe, says the product is popular in the hip-hop community and near college campuses in Houston and Atlanta. 
 
 Anderson says he uses the chocolate powder as an alternative to drinking when he goes out. He also reaches for a tin during long car rides, music festivals and in “those types of social situations when you feel anxious.” 
 
 He created his company, Legal Lean, two years ago with a $10,000 investment. The idea, he said, was to create a drug-free version of “lean” — a cough syrup-cocktail often made with promethazine or codeine that is known in hip-hop circles as “purple drank.” His grape-flavored version, formulated over three months, is made with herbal extracts and marketed as a “dietary supplement.” 
 
 It was a tough sell at first, Anderson says. People weren’t sure what to make of his syrup-y concoction. But his brother soon began hawking it in YouTube music videos, and they began taking it to trade shows, where it generated interest. Today, the company sells 40,000 to 50,000 bottles of Legal Lean (which retail for $12.50 a pop) each month. 
 
 (The reviews on online message boards, meanwhile, are mixed: “All I felt was drowsy,” a user named BodyAndBeats wrote on drugs-forum.com. “Put me right to sleep. Wasn’t fun at all,” said another, on IGN.com, a site for video game enthusiasts.) 
 
 As for Coco Loko, smoke shops and liquor stores have buying the product cautiously, says Alex P., sales director for Atlanta-based Exclusive Distributors, which distributes the products nationwide. (He declined to give his last name, he said, because “I don’t want people bugging me for all the wrong reasons.”) 
 
 “There’s definitely a buzz going around about this,” he said, adding that customers in recent years have been looking for items that make all-natural claims. “It’s not flying off the shelves or anything, but people are definitely curious.”

The newfangled nose candy leaves snorters with a ""euphoric"" feeling ""but also motivated to get things done,"" per founder Nick Anderson. He likens the buzz, which lasts for 30 minutes to an hour, to that of an energy drink. The 29-year-old Anderson, who runs the company Legal Lean, says he got the idea for Coco Loko a few months ago after hearing about a ""chocolate-snorting trend"" in Europe.

""No one's studied what happens if you inhale chocolate into your nose,"" one doc tells the Post. ABC10 notes that stuffing foreign substances up your schnoz could hurt mucous membranes, which keep bacteria and particles from entering the nose, among other issues. So does it work?

The product looks like hot cocoa powder or chocolate milk powder and is intended to be ingested through the nose. \n \n The Orlando-based company claims, Coco Loko results in an endorphin rush which mimics a ""runner\'s high"" and can also produce a euphoric energy ""similar to the feeling of ecstasy."" The product is marketed to people looking to party and who want an extra shot of energy. The company even claims athletes use the powder to obtain a ""natural competitive edge."" \n \n Anderson explained, Coco Loko gives the rush of eating a candy bar or a piece of chocolate cake, without the sugar crash. \n \n Coco Loko cacao snuff (Photo: Legal Lean) \n \n Snorting cocoa or cacao powder isn\'t a new trend. It\'s been a popular ""drug"" choice in European clubs for years. \n \n ""We wanted to create a new product that\'s marketable,"" Anderson said. \n \n Retailers, such as WalMart, Target and Amazon, already sell raw cacao in the U.S. Cacao is the purest form of chocolate and is considered a superfood for being high in antioxidants. It is not the same thing as cocoa, which is processed at higher heat. \n \n Coco Loko is the first cacao powder product to be sold in the U.S. specifically for the use of snorting. \n \n So why can\'t you just buy cacao powder at a retail store and ingest it through your nose? Why is Coco Loko any different? \n \n It\'s not. \n \n ""We\'re marketing to a niche market that wants convenience,"" Anderson said. ""We want to make it the cool thing."" \n \n Anderson explained, Coco Loko is sold in small, 1.25 ounce jars that are designed to pop into a person\'s pocket. This way, if a person wants to use it while out in a club, they can do so easily. \n \n The reason for snorting the product is to feel the effects immediately, according to Anderson. Coco Loko can be mixed with milk or a beverage but it takes longer to feel the effects, which isn\'t convenient for the person out and about looking for some fun. \n \n ""I could see all demographics buying it but younger people are usually more open to trying it than older people,"" Anderson said. \n \n Although Coco Loko is intended to snort while out partying, similar to drugs such as cocaine and MDMA, better known as Molly, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) doesn\'t regulate the cacao powder. \n \n In fact, DEA spokesperson, Casey Rettig, told ABC10 she\'d never heard of the product. The DEA only regulates products which contain Schedule I through V drugs. Cacao powder is not on any of the lists. \n \n ABC10 also reached out to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), who released this statement: \n \n ""The FDA is not prepared to issue a determination regarding whether and how this product is subject to FDA jurisdiction at this time."" said Peter Cassell, FDA spokesperson. ""In reaching that decision, FDA will need to evaluate the product labeling, marketing information, and/or any other information pertaining to the product’s intended use."" \n \n While Coco Loko is a legal product, it\'s not being regulated by the government and there are no current studies on the effects of snorting the cacao powder. \n \n ""We don\'t know what it does to the nose,"" said Dr. Toby Steele, ENT-otolaryngologist with University of California, Davis. \n \n Steele explained, in general, anything going up the nose other than nasal saline can damage mucus membranes, which help trap bacteria and other harmful particles entering the nose. \n \n The nose could also become irritated or experience blockage. \n \n ""What I would worry about the most is loss of sense of smell,"" Steele said. \n \n Losing the sense of smell could be potentially dangerous since it serves as a warning in certain situations such as a fire or natural gas leak. \n \n Steele doesn\'t recommend ingesting the cacao powder product through the nose. \n \n ""If a patient asked me if they should do it, I\'d say no,"" Steele said. \n \n Coco Loko isn\'t available in California stores yet. Anderson didn\'t have a date for when the product will hit California shelves but said it\'d be ""very soon."" \n \n However, the product is sold online for $24.99/1.25 oz. jar and is currently on sale for $19.99. \n \n VERIFY: Sources \n \n Nick Anderson, owner of Legal Lean \n \n Casey Rettig, spokesperson for U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, San Francisco Division \n \n Peter Cassell, spokesperson for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration \n \n Dr. Toby O.

The product, created by Orlando-based company Legal Lean, includes cacao powder, as well as gingko biloba, taurine and guarana, which are commonly found in energy drinks. \n \n Nick Anderson, the 29-year-old founder of Legal Lean, says he heard about a “chocolate-snorting trend” in Europe a few months ago. He ordered a sample and gave it a try. \n \n “At first, I was like, ‘Is this a hoax?,'” he recalled. “And then I tried it and it was like, okay, this is the future right here.” \n \n Each tin of Coco Loko comes with 10 servings and costs $24.99. (Courtesy of Legal Lean) \n \n That led him to invest $10,000 into creating his own “raw cacao snuff.” It took about 10 tries over two months to come up with the mixture, which was created by an Orlando-based supplement company. \n \n “Some versions, they just burned too much,” Anderson said. “Other times they looked gray and dull, or didn’t have enough stimulants.” \n \n The effects of the cacao-based powder, he said, last about 30 minutes to an hour, and are “almost like an energy-drink feeling, like you’re euphoric but also motivated to get things done.” \n \n But doctors say they’re not quite sure what to make of the brown powder, which hit U.S. shelves last month and is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. \n \n “The question is, what are the risks of doing it?” said Dr. Andrew Lane, director of the Johns Hopkins Sinus Center. “There’s no data, and as far as I can tell, no one’s studied what happens if you inhale chocolate into your nose. When I mention it to people, nobody’s ever heard of it.” (“Maybe,” he added, “I’m not in the in-crowd.”) \n \n Lane said he wasn’t particularly worried that “snortable” chocolate could become a gateway drug, as users become accustomed to getting a buzz by inhaling powders. \n \n “If you’re going to do drugs, you probably don’t start with chocolate,” he said. “Certainly this is better than using an illicit drug.” \n \n The medical community has long raised concerns about the health effects of energy drinks — which often rely on caffeine, taurine and guarana, and have been shown to raise blood pressure and cause heart palpitations. Lane says those effects could be magnified if a person inhales those stimulants. \n \n [FDA report describing deaths sheds light on high-caffeine beverages] \n \n “There are a few obvious concerns,” he said. “First, it’s not clear how much of each ingredient would be absorbed into the nasal mucus membranes. And, well, putting solid material into your nose — you could imagine it getting stuck in there, or the chocolate mixing with your mucus to create a paste that could block your sinuses.” \n \n A spokesman for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it had not decided whether, or how, the agency would regulate the product. \n \n “In reaching that decision, FDA will need to evaluate the product labeling, marketing information, and/or any other information pertaining to the product’s intended use,” spokesman Peter Cassell said in an email. \n \n A representative for the Drug Enforcement Administration, meanwhile, said he was not aware of any agency concerns related to chocolate inhalants. \n \n Tins of Coco Loko, which have about 10 servings, sell for $24.99. Anderson, whose brother is a rapper named Bezz Believe, says the product is popular in the hip-hop community and near college campuses in Houston and Atlanta. \n \n Anderson says he uses the chocolate powder as an alternative to drinking when he goes out. He also reaches for a tin during long car rides, music festivals and in “those types of social situations when you feel anxious.” \n \n He created his company, Legal Lean, two years ago with a $10,000 investment. The idea, he said, was to create a drug-free version of “lean” — a cough syrup-cocktail often made with promethazine or codeine that is known in hip-hop circles as “purple drank.” His grape-flavored version, formulated over three months, is made with herbal extracts and marketed as a “dietary supplement.” \n \n It was a tough sell at first, Anderson says. People weren’t sure what to make of his syrup-y concoction. But his brother soon began hawking it in YouTube music videos, and they began taking it to trade shows, where it generated interest. Today, the company sells 40,000 to 50,000 bottles of Legal Lean (which retail for $12.50 a pop) each month. \n \n (The reviews on online message boards, meanwhile, are mixed: “All I felt was drowsy,” a user named BodyAndBeats wrote on drugs-forum.com. “Put me right to sleep. Wasn’t fun at all,” said another, on IGN.com, a site for video game enthusiasts.) \n \n As for Coco Loko, smoke shops and liquor stores have buying the product cautiously, says Alex P., sales director for Atlanta-based Exclusive Distributors, which distributes the products nationwide. (He declined to give his last name, he said, because “I don’t want people bugging me for all the wrong reasons.”) \n \n “There’s definitely a buzz going around about this,” he said, adding that customers in recent years have been looking for items that make all-natural claims. “It’s not flying off the shelves or anything, but people are definitely curious.” \n \n Read more: \n \n The whopping fine Carl’s Jr. was ordered to pay for allegedly shortchanging workers \n \n A man is suing Hershey for ‘under-filling’ his box of Whoppers \n \n Walmart is asking employees to deliver packages on their way home from work \n \n Walmart’s answer to Aldi and Amazon: ‘designer cantaloupe’""]",4
"Feb. 12 (UPI) -- A cheating boyfriend found his belongings out on the street when he was busted in the comments section of a Burger King Instagram post. 
 
 The Jan. 11 post on Burger King's Instagram page received a comment from user jordan_vonsmith86, who wrote: ""My girl legit took 20 minutes ordering in the drive thru last night, those whoppers were worth it tho lol."" 
 
 The comment soon received a reply from the user's girlfriend, Instagram user shanlee_rose. 
 
 ""Umm excuse me @jordan_vonsmith86??? I don't recall going last night or ever liking Burger King who are you talking about?"" she wrote. 
 
 A follow-up comment implored the man to ""answer your [expletive] phone."" 
 
 Shanlee_rose tagged some friends in the comments, and they responded by saying they were not surprised to learn the man was cheating and he had been seen with another girl at a showing of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. 
 
 The boyfriend shot back: ""@shanlee_rose you need to chill out, I was with @kitcass01 and we were just catching up."" 
 
 Kitcass01 replied to the thread, saying ""please don't bring me into this,"" but shanlee_rose was having none of it. 
 
 ""@kitcass01 [expletive] you, you brought yourself into this you fat [expletive],"" shanlee_rose wrote. 
 
 The exchange ended with a parting shot from the man's now-ex-girlfriend: ""Hope the whopper jr's were worth it. Your shit's outside."" 
 
 Other commenters on the Instagram post were shocked to witness the exchange. 
 
 ""Did I seriously just witness a breakup on BK's instagram?"" one user asked. ||||| We’re almost two solid months into 2017 and the best thing that has happened this year is still the Wendy’s Twitter account. It has completely shut down critics of its never-frozen beef and, as of this morning, it’s still serving up clapbacks even faster than it serves its customers. But the most recent must-see fast food social media account belonged to Burger King, where a cheating boyfriend was busted in its Instagram comments section. (That’s a sentence that would’ve made zero sense a decade ago—and it still barely makes sense today.) 
 
 The story—as first reported by one of Britain’s wire-tappiest tabloids—started when an Instagram user named Jordan von Smith typed out an innocuous-sounding complaint about the service he and his girlfriend got at their local Burger King. “My girl legit took 20 minutes ordering in the drive thru last night, those whoppers were worth it tho lol,” he wrote beneath a picture of two artfully styled breakfast sandwiches. 
 
 Be the breakfast you wish to see in the world. #Repost @edgar4president A photo posted by Burger King (@burgerking) on Jan 11, 2017 at 7:34am PST 
 
 Burger King didn’t respond to his complaint, but his actual girlfriend did. “Umm excuse me @jordan_vonsmith86??? I don’t recall going last night or ever liking Burger King who are you talking about?” a woman named Shannon Boyd responded. She then tagged two of her friends, because that’s where we are right now: when your dude takes another girl for Whoppers, you definitely want backup when you’re confronting him with Instagram comments. 
 
 “You need to chill out, I was with @kitcass01 and we were just catching up,” von Smith responded, because women love being told to chill out or calm down. Then Cassandra Estrada – KitCass01 – asked von Smith “not to bring [her] into this.” 
 
 By this point, everyone has completely transformed into that .gif of Michael Jackson eating popcorn, right? Because Boyd then told Estrada “You brought yourself into this, you fat bitch,” before alerting von Smith that his “shit’s outside.” 
 
 OK, although as much as I love the idea of a couple splitting up because of an extracurricular fast-food order, I also don’t believe this for a second. Because what are the odds that a girl is just idly scrolling through all of Burger King’s comments before she sees her two-timing boyfriend’s username? And what are the odds that the guy, the girl, and her two friends are all going to comment in quick succession? 
 
 And—even more suspiciously—all five accounts (Von Smith, Boyd, Estrada and the two friends Boyd tagged) are all private, have all posted between 40 and 55 pictures, and all have between seven and 12 followers. Also, the profile pic of “Shannon Boyd” was a cropped version of a picture used in a Playbuzz article called “What Sort of Housewife Will You Be [Teen Version]” and is credited to a website that puts together Hawaiian wedding packages. 
 
 So, well played, whoever is behind this. The original Burger King picture was posted four weeks ago—about the time that Wendy’s was destroying trolls and taking names—so maybe BK hoped to get a sip of that sweet social media Frosty. Or maybe it’s someone who was just bored enough to create an entire Whopper-themed breakup to fool people like me into writing about it. Either way, MUNCHIES has reached out to Burger King for comment.

 Even on Burger King's Instagram.","– Juggling two women can be so tricky. These days, one must divide and conquer on social media as well as in the physical world. UPI International reports that one man found this out the hard way, via Burger King's Instagram page, though a blogger at Munchies smells either a hoax or a marketing ploy. It all began with this post: ""My girl legit took 20 minutes ordering in the drive thru last night, those whoppers were worth it tho lol."" And it didn't take long for the follow-up comment from @shanlee_rose: ""Umm excuse me @jordan_vonsmith86??? I don't recall going last night or ever liking Burger King who are you talking about?"" Pretty soon the other girl, @Kitcass01, chimed in that she didn't want to be dragged into anything, to which girlfriend No. 1 unleashed some choice language (maybe too choice for a marketing stunt?) and let her now ex-boyfriend know that he could find his belongings outside. Read it in full at BuzzFeed. It's ""absolutely savage,"" declares Mashable. Commenters have expressed mainly shock (""Did I seriously just witness a breakup on BK's Instagram?"") and disbelief (""That couple fighting is fake"").

"But you can’t get a deal unless you can get the votes. And what’s been clear for some time is Speaker John Boehner cannot get the votes. If you need more evidence, look at the letter Boehner sent his caucus, which is more about pretending that he supports Cut, Cap and Balance -- an absurd and unpassable policy that includes a constitutional amendment making tax increases nearly impossible and capping spending at levels not seen since 1957 -- than it is about informing them as to what’s happened in the negotiations. It’s as if the president walked away from the table and sent out a letter saying that Boehner wouldn’t agree to single-payer health care, and so the negotiations are over. 
 
 But that’s what made the latest round of interest in the $4 trillion deal so peculiar. The policy was essentially unchanged from the $4 trillion deal that Boehner and Majority Leader Eric Cantor walked away from two weeks ago -- a deal that included about half as much in tax increases as Simpson-Bowles or the Gang of Six . When they walked away, it was because they couldn’t find the votes for a compromise, even one tilted towards conservative interests. Despite all the excitement about them returning to the table this week, no one had ever answered the first question that needed to be asked: Had they found the votes? And if so, how? 
 
 We now know the answer. 
 
 It’s easy to get caught up in the political machinations. It’s easy to begin speculating about the hopes, constraints, and hidden agendas of the players. It’s easy to sound like an insider and say that the House GOP cannot accept a deal until the very last minute, or unleash some long analysis of how the president’s evident frustration will play with the voters, or say that the real story here is the relationship between Boehner and Cantor. But here’s the bottom line: We have 11 calendar days to raise the debt ceiling. Already, there’s some evidence that our dithering is hurting the economy. If we truly fail to raise the debt ceiling, however, we will unleash a market panic that will, at the least, return us to recession, and if it’s not quickly quelled, metastasize into a financial crisis that we will not soon recover from. 
 
 Earlier today, I spoke with David Beers, director of Standard Poor’s sovereign debt department. He explained that it wasn’t economic factors that had put America’s credit rating at risk, nor world events. It was credit-rating agency’s increasing fears that our political system was no longer up to the challenges that face it. “What we’re saying now,” said Beers, “is we question whether despite all the discussions and intense negotiations, if they can’t reach this agreement, will they be able to reach it after the election?” 
 
 If we convince Standard Poor’s that our political system has failed, they will downgrade our credit within three months. If they do that, interest rates on our debt will spike, perhaps by 50 basis points, perhaps by more. An easy rule of thumb is that if interest rates rise by 50 basis points, we will lose 600,000 jobs in this country. 
 
 At this point, there are three serious options on the table. A $4 trillion deal that includes some revenues, a $1 trillion-$2 trillion deal that’s all spending cuts but leaves much of the job until after the election, and a deal in which Republicans don’t come to a negotiated agreement with President Obama but they grant him the authority -- and let him take the blame -- for raising the debt ceiling. Those are our three options, and Congress needs to pick one. Time is running short.

 Obama-Boehner talks collapse with blame on both sides 
 
 READ: Boehner’s letter to House Republicans 
 
 The Fix: A lose-lose proposition 
 
 PHOTOS: The clock ticks down ||||| By Steve Benen 
 
 Late yesterday, a senior Republican aide told the Washington Post that House GOP leaders have “no idea” how to resolve the debt-ceiling crisis they created. Those two words — “no idea” — are the kind of words that may cause some panic. 
 
 But at the risk of beating a dead horse, at least one lawmaker has an easy solution that would resolve the problem in minutes. 
 
 Rep. Peter Welch (D-Vt.) said House Speaker John Boehner’s (R-Ohio) decision to end negotiations with President Obama on a sweeping deficit-reduction package to accompany a debt-ceiling hike was “shocking,” “dangerous” and risks an economic calamity. “I want the opportunity to vote straight up” on a clean debt-ceiling bill, Welch said in a phone interview Friday night. 
 
 Welch led the push for a clean bill in May, which was soundly defeated as part of a GOP stunt. But in May, few thought the crisis would intensify to its current point. 
 
 “That was a show vote, intended to try to increase their leverage,” Welch told The Hill last night. “It was not consequential…. This time it would matter. We’re now on the brink of default.” 
 
 Now, I know what Republicans are going to say. Or more specifically, I know what they’ll say after they stop laughing. The GOP will argue they need the debt ceiling for leverage, and passing a clean bill would make it harder to strike a debt-reduction deal, since Republicans would lose their hostage. 
 
 But I’d suggest they simply take a different hostage. They could, first thing Monday morning, take a few minutes to raise the debt ceiling, and then immediately announce they’ll shut down the government in the fall unless Democrats agree to a large debt-reduction package. The fiscal year only goes through September anyway, which isn’t that far off. 
 
 President Obama clearly wants to reach a debt-reduction agreement, and both parties would have an incentive to avoid a shutdown in a few months. It would give policymakers time to continue negotiations, without running the risk of a global economic catastrophe (which, Dems could remind Republicans, would likely be blamed on the GOP). 
 
 Wall Street, global markets, the private sector, state and local governments, and consumers would all be thrilled. Democrats would be relieved, and Republicans could wipe their hands of this mess and get ready for the next big showdown. 
 
 What’s more, there’s ample precedent for this. There have been bipartisan debt-reduction packages crafted before, but there’s never been a need to tie the process to the debt ceiling.

 08/02/2011 1:44 PM EDT Obama: Let The Pivot To Jobs Begin Speaking just minutes after the Senate passed legislation to raise the debt ceiling -- removing the last political hurdle for that bill's passage – President Obama delivered a speech in the Rose Garden in which he once again pleaded for a renewed focus on jobs. Sounding at times exasperated that the political conversation had veered so swiftly to the topic of austerity, Obama urged Congress to present him with job-creating bills as soon as it returned from its August recess. The specifics were pretty much the same as the White House has pushed for weeks if not months: free trade agreements, patent reform, an infrastructure bank, regulatory changes and the extension of the payroll tax cut and unemployment benefits. ""Growing the economy isn’t just about cutting spending, it is not about rolling back regulations that protect our air and water and keep people safe. That is not how we are going to get past this recession. We are going to have to do more than that,"" he said. ""There already is a quiet crisis going on in the lives of a lot of families and a lot communities all across the country. They are looking for work and they have been for a while ... that ought to compel Washington to cooperate, that ought to compel Washington to compromise and that ought to compel Washington to act."" Coming so soon after both the president and a large portion of the Democratic party signed off on a bill that takes roughly $2.4 trillion out of the economy in the next 10 years, it was hard to imagine that the remedies being offered would have much of a cumulative effect. Moreover, a ""pivot"" to jobs was already tried unsuccessfully after the tax cut debate at the end of 2010 and the government shut down debate in the spring of 2011. But Obama's speech was more about establishing the proper tone than it was about forging out new legislative remedies. With the debt ceiling debate now over until after the 2012 election, the major discussion shifts back to what, if anything, government can do to spur economic growth. One portion of that argument will come when Congress must pass a budget to fund the government by the end of September. But the White House will likely try and create some sort of defining contrast between the president and his Republican critics well before then. -- Sam Stein

 By Mike Lillis - 
 
 Friday's implosion of budget talks between House Republicans and the White House leaves Congress with little choice but to vote on a clean debt-ceiling hike to stave off default, according to the most dogged supporter of that strategy. 
 
 Rep. Peter Welch (D-Vt.) said House Speaker John Boehner's (R-Ohio) decision to end negotiations with President Obama on a sweeping deficit-reduction package to accompany a debt-ceiling hike was ""shocking,"" ""dangerous"" and risks an economic calamity. 
 
 ""I want the opportunity to vote straight up"" on a clean debt-ceiling bill, Welch said in a phone interview Friday night. 
 
 Welch accused Republican leaders of ""taking the economy over the cliff to get their way."" 
 
 ""It raises the question of whether their intention is getting a deal or defaulting,"" Welch said. ""We're witnessing political leverage gone wild."" 
 
 In May, Welch led the effort to pressure GOP leaders to stage a clean debt-limit hike, rallying the support of 114 House Democrats. 
 
 A few weeks later, the Republicans obliged. The bill was shot down in a lopsided 318-97 vote considered by Democrats to be a political trap to put members on the record supporting an unpopular policy that Republicans intended to kill anyway. 
 
 Welch said the dynamics are much different now. 
 
 ""That was a show vote, intended to try to increase their leverage,"" he said. ""It was not consequential. 
 
 ""This time it would matter,"" he added. ""We're now on the brink of default."" 
 
 Still, the Vermont Democrat conceded that Republicans likely won't bring a clean debt-limit vote to the floor. 
 
 Boehner on Friday announced abruptly – and after markets closed – that he's through talking with the White House over a huge deficit-reduction deal because Obama was asking for too much in new tax revenues. 
 
 ""The White House moved the goal post,"" Boehner charged at a press conference, saying the sticking point was $400 billion in new taxes demanded by the White House. 
 
 Obama had aired his own frustrations over the impasse just an hour earlier, accusing Republicans of refusing to agree to anything. 
 
 “I've been left at the altar now a couple of times,” said a stern Obama. 
 
 The Speaker said he'll begin huddling down with Senate leaders Friday night in search of a stop-gap measure to prevent a government default before the Aug. 2 deadline. 
 
 “No one wants to default on the full faith and credit of the United States of America,” Boehner said. 
 
 Not ready to give up on a larger deficit-reduction deal, Obama has also invited bipartisan leaders from both chambers to meet at the White House at 11 a.m. Saturday – a meeting Boehner said he would attend. 
 
 “They are going to have to explain to me how it is that we are going to avoid default,” Obama said. 
 
 Asked what the next step should be, Welch deferred to the Republicans. 
 
 ""It's up to Mr. Boehner,"" he said. ""He's got a tough job, but it is his job.""","– As President Obama meets this morning with congressional leaders on the debt ceiling, one number matters most of all: Eleven. As in, the number of days until the government defaults, writes Ezra Klein in the Washington Post. With crunch time here, Klein sees three options left, and he says Congress better pick one in a hurry: ""A $4 trillion deal that includes some revenues"" ""A $1 trillion-$2 trillion deal that’s all spending cuts but leaves much of the job until after the election"" ""A deal in which Republicans don’t come to a negotiated agreement with President Obama but they grant him the authority—and let him take the blame—for raising the debt ceiling."" Click to read Klein's full column. Another alternative: One Democratic lawmaker wants a straight-up vote on raising the debt ceiling, the Hill reports, and Steve Benen at Washington Monthly thinks the GOP could make it work. Click for more.","['But you can’t get a deal unless you can get the votes. And what’s been clear for some time is Speaker John Boehner cannot get the votes. If you need more evidence, look at the letter Boehner sent his caucus, which is more about pretending that he supports Cut, Cap and Balance -- an absurd and unpassable policy that includes a constitutional amendment making tax increases nearly impossible and capping spending at levels not seen since 1957 -- than it is about informing them as to what’s happened in the negotiations. It’s as if the president walked away from the table and sent out a letter saying that Boehner wouldn’t agree to single-payer health care, and so the negotiations are over. \n \n But that’s what made the latest round of interest in the $4 trillion deal so peculiar. The policy was essentially unchanged from the $4 trillion deal that Boehner and Majority Leader Eric Cantor walked away from two weeks ago -- a deal that included about half as much in tax increases as Simpson-Bowles or the Gang of Six . When they walked away, it was because they couldn’t find the votes for a compromise, even one tilted towards conservative interests. Despite all the excitement about them returning to the table this week, no one had ever answered the first question that needed to be asked: Had they found the votes? And if so, how? \n \n We now know the answer. \n \n It’s easy to get caught up in the political machinations. It’s easy to begin speculating about the hopes, constraints, and hidden agendas of the players. It’s easy to sound like an insider and say that the House GOP cannot accept a deal until the very last minute, or unleash some long analysis of how the president’s evident frustration will play with the voters, or say that the real story here is the relationship between Boehner and Cantor. But here’s the bottom line: We have 11 calendar days to raise the debt ceiling. Already, there’s some evidence that our dithering is hurting the economy. If we truly fail to raise the debt ceiling, however, we will unleash a market panic that will, at the least, return us to recession, and if it’s not quickly quelled, metastasize into a financial crisis that we will not soon recover from. \n \n Earlier today, I spoke with David Beers, director of Standard Poor’s sovereign debt department. He explained that it wasn’t economic factors that had put America’s credit rating at risk, nor world events. It was credit-rating agency’s increasing fears that our political system was no longer up to the challenges that face it. “What we’re saying now,” said Beers, “is we question whether despite all the discussions and intense negotiations, if they can’t reach this agreement, will they be able to reach it after the election?” \n \n If we convince Standard Poor’s that our political system has failed, they will downgrade our credit within three months. If they do that, interest rates on our debt will spike, perhaps by 50 basis points, perhaps by more. An easy rule of thumb is that if interest rates rise by 50 basis points, we will lose 600,000 jobs in this country. \n \n At this point, there are three serious options on the table. A $4 trillion deal that includes some revenues, a $1 trillion-$2 trillion deal that’s all spending cuts but leaves much of the job until after the election, and a deal in which Republicans don’t come to a negotiated agreement with President Obama but they grant him the authority -- and let him take the blame -- for raising the debt ceiling. Those are our three options, and Congress needs to pick one. Time is running short. \n \n Related: Everything you need to know about the debt ceiling in one post. \n \n ALSO ON THE WASHINGTON POST: \n \n Obama-Boehner talks collapse with blame on both sides \n \n READ: Boehner’s letter to House Republicans \n \n The Fix: A lose-lose proposition \n \n PHOTOS: The clock ticks down ', ' By Steve Benen \n \n Late yesterday, a senior Republican aide told the Washington Post that House GOP leaders have “no idea” how to resolve the debt-ceiling crisis they created. Those two words — “no idea” — are the kind of words that may cause some panic. \n \n But at the risk of beating a dead horse, at least one lawmaker has an easy solution that would resolve the problem in minutes. \n \n Rep. Peter Welch (D-Vt.) said House Speaker John Boehner’s (R-Ohio) decision to end negotiations with President Obama on a sweeping deficit-reduction package to accompany a debt-ceiling hike was “shocking,” “dangerous” and risks an economic calamity. “I want the opportunity to vote straight up” on a clean debt-ceiling bill, Welch said in a phone interview Friday night. \n \n Welch led the push for a clean bill in May, which was soundly defeated as part of a GOP stunt. But in May, few thought the crisis would intensify to its current point. \n \n “That was a show vote, intended to try to increase their leverage,” Welch told The Hill last night. “It was not consequential…. This time it would matter. We’re now on the brink of default.” \n \n Now, I know what Republicans are going to say. Or more specifically, I know what they’ll say after they stop laughing. The GOP will argue they need the debt ceiling for leverage, and passing a clean bill would make it harder to strike a debt-reduction deal, since Republicans would lose their hostage. \n \n But I’d suggest they simply take a different hostage. They could, first thing Monday morning, take a few minutes to raise the debt ceiling, and then immediately announce they’ll shut down the government in the fall unless Democrats agree to a large debt-reduction package. The fiscal year only goes through September anyway, which isn’t that far off. \n \n President Obama clearly wants to reach a debt-reduction agreement, and both parties would have an incentive to avoid a shutdown in a few months. It would give policymakers time to continue negotiations, without running the risk of a global economic catastrophe (which, Dems could remind Republicans, would likely be blamed on the GOP). \n \n Wall Street, global markets, the private sector, state and local governments, and consumers would all be thrilled. Democrats would be relieved, and Republicans could wipe their hands of this mess and get ready for the next big showdown. \n \n What’s more, there’s ample precedent for this. There have been bipartisan debt-reduction packages crafted before, but there’s never been a need to tie the process to the debt ceiling. There’s a good reason for that: playing with the ceiling is too dangerous, as GOP leaders have no doubt noticed by now. \n \n One effortless vote could make the crisis disappear, while setting the stage for the budget battle royale Republicans want. So why not pass the damn bill and move on?

 Police caught up with Mr. Bourque along Mecca Dr., roughly a kilometre from the trailer park where he lived and 800 meters from the tidy suburban streets where his rampage began. 
 
 An officer radioed ""14alpha12, he's here on Mecca"" shortly after the arrest, according to archived scanner audio at broadcastify.com. 
 
 Mecca Drive is an area of two-storey middle class homes where Mr. Bourque would have had a clear sight of residents as well as traffic on nearby Wheeler Blvd. 
 
 A Moncton resident named Michelle Thibodeau tweeted that she witnessed the arrest. 
 
 ""He was in my backyard. I saw him arrested in front of my eyes. He is alive,"" Ms.Thibodeau tweeted. 
 
 ""The swat team arrived at my house and unloaded and started screaming in my backyard for him to surrender and he did. I watched it happen. 
 
 ""They had him sprawled on my front lawn for some time and then loaded him into the swat vehicle. They are now checking my yard for firearms."" 
 
 At least six officers remained on the scene around 3 a.m. One woman out for a walk in the driving rain shortly after the arrest said she heard police yelling at the suspect before hearing him yelling ""I'm done"" just after midnight. 
 
 According to police, the suspect was spotted three times on Thursday but could not be apprehended. By afternoon, police snipers moved into position and officers surrounded a rooming house in Moncton. But after clearing the building, they left empty-handed. As night fell, the RCMP asked residents to stay locked in their homes and keep their porch lights on. 
 
 “This is working through your worst nightmare,” RCMP Assistant Commissioner Roger Brown, the force’s commanding officer in New Brunswick, said Thursday as the search was still underway. “This is a very, very dangerous situation.” 
 
 Military-style armored vehicles patrolled the roads while helicopters whirred overhead. Tensions were high as police were grieving the loss of three colleagues, the worst mass shooting of police officers in Canada since the 2005 slaying of four officers at Mayerthorpe, Alta. 
 
 The officers in Moncton were gunned down in an ambush, police sources told The Globe and Mail. 
 
 One of the slain Mounties was Constable Dave Ross of the Codiac RCMP, according to several media reports. Constable Ross, a police dog handler, was married with a young son and another child on the way. His sister-in-law told The National Post that his widow came home to find the barbecue still running and Constable Ross gone, as he had been called to work urgently, likely after the first reports of a gunman at large.

 Police have arrested a suspect in the Moncton shootings that left three Mounties dead and kept much of the city’s residents locked in their homes. 
 
 After a manhunt that stretched into a second night, police said a suspect was finally arrested. 
 
 As the shootings unfolded Wednesday evening, the suspect had been photographed wearing camouflage and carrying what appeared to be two rifles. 
 
 Police had warned people in the northern Moncton area to stay inside and lock their doors, as a small army of officers, tactical team members and police dogs conducted a ground search. 
 
 A police helicopter had also been deployed in the manhunt, and officers from across the province had arrived to assist. 
 
 Twitter user Michelle Thibodeau appeared to post a first-hand account of the arrest, saying: “He was in my backyard. I saw him arrested in front of my eyes. He is alive. Thanks you #RCMPNB” 
 
 Thibodeau spoke to CTV News and said the suspect came out in her backyard with his arms raised and told police “I’m done.” 
 
 Developing story... ||||| Justin Bourque, the 24-year-old suspected of carrying out a shooting that left three Mounties dead and two others wounded, has been apprehended by RCMP in Moncton, N.B. 
 
 RCMP spokesman Paul Greene said Bourque was arrested at 12:10 a.m. AT Friday. 
 
 Moncton resident Michelle Thibodeau told CBC News and other media that Bourque was arrested in her backyard in the northwest part of the city where the shooting occurred and which had been on lockdown while the manhunt for the suspect was underway. 
 
 Police advised residents on Twitter soon after the arrest that they can now leave their homes and move freely. The City of Moncton tweeted that city services, including buses, will resume as usual Friday. Schools will remain closed. 
 
 RCMP will hold a news conference to provide further details of the arrest at just after 8 a.m. AT in Moncton. The Canadian Press reported that Bourque is being held at the RCMP detachment in Sackville, N.B. 
 
 'I'm done,' suspected shooter reported as saying 
 
 Thibodeau said she saw police officers head into a patch of trees in her yard and heard five minutes of screaming. 
 
 “Justin came out with his hands up, and he said, 'I'm done,'"" she told CBC News. 
 
 She said he was wearing the same clothes he had been seen in Wednesday and was dripping wet, likely from the rain that was falling in Moncton at the time. 
 
 Moncton Mayor George LeBlanc reflected on Friday morning about the impact of the last two days on his city. 
 
 ""Moncton has always been known as a very resilient community. We have been through hard times before, not like this mind you, but I really do think the community will come together and we will find our way through this,"" he said. 
 
 The mayor said it is important to support the police and the family members who lost loved ones in the shooting. He said the relief of Bourque's overnight arrest will soon be taken over by the grief for the family members. 
 
 ""I think it is going to be a bittersweet day. I think there will be a lot of sadness,"" LeBlanc said. 
 
 ""I think the happiness and elation over the arrest of the suspect will continue but I think as time goes on, I think that people will realize how the families and all of us will have to come to terms with the terrible loss that this has caused us."" 
 
 New Brunswick Premier David Alward said his thoughts were with the families who lost loved ones. 
 
 ""These events have been among the most shocking and heart-wrenching moments in my service as premier,"" he said. 
 
 One of the slain officers was identified as Dave Ross, a Quebec-born Mountie who had lived in New Brunswick for seven years. Ross was a married father of a 19-month-old with another baby on the way, his mother-in-law told CBC News. 
 
 ""To the families, friends and colleagues of the fallen officers, although we cannot know the full impact of your suffering, your fellow New Brunswickers share the horror and pain. You are not alone in your grief. Our hearts, minds and prayers are with you during the difficult days ahead,"" Alward said. 
 
 1 of 2 wounded officers released from hospital 
 
 Alward asked people to also remember the two officers who were wounded and all of the emergency services staff who helped during the shooting and subsequent manhunt. The two wounded officers underwent surgery Thursday. One was released, and the other remains hospitalized. 
 
 ""When faced with tragedy, it is normal to feel bewildered and shocked,"" Alward said. ""It is important to reach out to our family, friends and neighbours to work through the grief and stress that these events have caused, and encourage people to express themselves."" 
 
 
 
 ""Children, in particular, may have difficulties expressing their feelings and confusion."" 
 
 
 
 He added that those feeling overwhelmed can get help in New Brunswick by dialing 811. People can send their condolences to the RCMP at Condolences_Condoleances@rcmp-grc.gc.ca. 
 
 'Absolutely surreal' 
 
 A feeling of relief swept through the city. Resident Joey Stokes went to the police headquarters to show his support. 
 
 ""Our city's safe again,"" he said. ""We live in Moncton. We're pretty tight-knit, everybody's friendly. To have this happen here, it's absolutely surreal."" 
 
 Matthew Bachman also went to the police station on a wet, cold night. 
 
 “It just felt like we should go out and show our support,” Bachman said. “I was just glued to the TV the last two days.” 
 
 Police, including tactical officers, began their manhunt for the suspected shooter Wednesday at around 7:30 p.m. AT after responding to a call about a man walking along a road with what looked to be a gun. 
 
 After the call, shots were fired and officers called for backup. 
 
 The RCMP said police officers from across the country were brought in to help arrest the suspect.","– After a manhunt that lasted more than 24 hours, police say that the man believed to have shot three Canadian Mounties dead is in custody and that residents of Moncton, New Brunswick, can safely leave their homes.

The northern part of the small city had been locked down since three officers were killed and two others wounded Wednesday night.

"On December 19, the Electors of the Electoral College will cast their ballots. If they all vote the way their states voted, Donald Trump will win. However, in 14 of the states in Trump's column, they can vote for Hillary Clinton without any legal penalty if they choose. 
 
 We are calling on the 149 Electors in those states to ignore their states' votes and cast their ballots for Secretary Clinton. Why? 
 
 Mr. Trump is unfit to serve. His scapegoating of so many Americans, and his impulsivity, bullying, lying, admitted history of sexual assault, and utter lack of experience make him a danger to the Republic. 
 
 Secretary Clinton WON THE POPULAR VOTE and should be President. 
 
 Hillary won the popular vote. The only reason Trump ""won"" is because of the Electoral College. 
 
 But the Electoral College can actually give the White House to either candidate. So why not use this most undemocratic of our institutions to ensure a democratic result? 
 
 SHE WON THE POPULAR VOTE. 
 
 There is no reason Trump should be President. 
 
 ""It's the 'People's Will'"" 
 
 No. She won the popular vote. 
 
 ""Our system of government under our Constitution says he wins"" 
 
 No. Our Constitution says the Electors choose. 
 
 ""Too many states prohibit 'Faithless Electors'"" 
 
 24 states bind electors. If electors vote against their party, they usually pay a fine. And people get mad. But they can vote however they want and there is no legal means to stop them in most states. 
 
 PLEASE SIGN AND SHARE! ||||| The college’s members come from all 50 states and Washington, D.C.; the number of electors a state has corresponds with the number of House and Senate members who represent it in Congress. Baca and Chiafalo are not pushing for Republican electors to all switch their allegiance to Clinton, who’s winning the popular vote nationwide even as her Electoral College count lags behind Trump’s. Instead, they suggest a “compromise candidate”—a Republican they find less objectionable than Trump, such as former Republican nominee Mitt Romney or Ohio Governor John Kasich. (Though those options are just placeholders; they said it should be up to the Republican electors to pick a new standard-bearer.) 
 
 Baca described their best-case scenario: uniting 135 Republican and 135 Democratic electors behind a moderate Republican candidate, thus securing that person’s position as president with the required 270 votes. If that doesn’t work, and it’s highly unlikely it will, they’re hoping they can at least convince 37 of the Republican electors whose states went for Trump to default and support the compromise candidate. That would bring Trump’s count below 270, and the election would then go to the House of Representatives. While there’s a strong chance that, in that hypothetical scenario, the Republican-controlled House would nevertheless vote to install Trump, Baca and Chiafolo would hope that, given the opportunity, they would support a more conventional Republican instead. 
 
 This would be in the legislature’s best interest, Baca said, because a different Republican candidate who “actually knows what they’re doing” would be able to more smoothly enact a Republican Congress’s agenda. Though Baca and Chiafolo’s states voted for Clinton, they said they would both gladly support a moderate compromise candidate from the GOP; Chiafolo, a Bernie Sanders supporter during the Democratic primary, previously told a Seattle Times reporter that he hadn’t “ruled out” withholding his vote from Clinton. 
 
 So far, seven Democratic electors, including Baca and Chiafolo, are willing to support a Republican candidate other than Trump. No Republican electors have come on board yet. But “we hope that once the first Republican peels away, once we have one who is brave enough to stick to their morals,” Baca said, “then we’ll see a wave of support.” 
 
 They’re not currently contacting the Republican electors directly and discourage their supporters from doing so. Instead, they’re focusing on getting the word out through a social-media campaign and through their website. “The general strategy right now is to educate and support the Republican electors, to let them know that they have the right—the duty—to pick who they think is right for the presidency,” Chiafalo said. 
 
 College of Charleston political science professor Claire Wofford explained to me that the founding fathers were actually quite afraid of direct democracy; they put the Electoral College in place as a fail-safe to protect the American presidency from a candidate who’s popular but unfit for office. “Several features of our government are designed to ‘filter’ what the [constitutional] framers saw might be the irrationality and emotion of the populace, including the Electoral College,” she said. “So you could argue that the election of Trump is just such an instance, in which a demagogue has somehow managed to ‘sway’ an easily misled public.” Wofford said “there is no explicit federal or constitutional ban on electors selecting candidates as they wish, even if that means departing from the popular vote of the state.” ||||| At least a half-dozen Democratic electors have signed onto an attempt to block Donald Trump from winning an Electoral College majority, an effort designed not only to deny Trump the presidency but also to undermine the legitimacy of the institution. 
 
 The presidential electors, mostly former Bernie Sanders supporters who hail from Washington state and Colorado, are now lobbying their Republican counterparts in other states to reject their oaths — and in some cases, state law — to vote against Trump when the Electoral College meets on Dec. 19.

 Even the most optimistic among the Democratic electors acknowledges they're unlikely to persuade the necessary 37 Republican electors to reject Trump — the number they'd likely need to deny him the presidency and send the final decision to the House of Representatives. And even if they do, the Republican-run House might simply elect Trump anyway. 
 
 But the Democratic electors are convinced that even in defeat, their efforts would erode confidence in the Electoral College and fuel efforts to eliminate it, ending the body’s 228-year run as the only official constitutional process for electing the president. With that goal in mind, the group is also contemplating encouraging Democratic electors to oppose Hillary Clinton and partner with Republicans in support of a consensus pick like Mitt Romney or John Kasich. 
 
 The underlying idea is that a mass defection of electors could provide the impetus for a wave of changes to the Electoral College. 
 
 ""I do think that a byproduct would be a serious look into Electoral College reform,"" said Micheal Baca, a Democratic elector from Colorado who is spearheading the anti-Trump effort, along with Washington state elector P. Bret Chiafalo. 
 
 ""If it gets into the House, the controversy and the uncertainty that would immediately blow up into a political firestorm in the U.S. would cause enough people — my hope is — to look at the whole concept of the Electoral College,"" said another elector involved in the anti-Trump planning, who declined to be identified. 
 
 One prominent Electoral College critic says that even if Trump wins easily on Dec. 19, a small number of Republican defections could still roil the future of the institution. 
 
 ""If you could get eight or 10 Trump electors to vote for someone else ... then that would probably get people's attention,"" said George Edwards III, a political science professor and Electoral College expert at Texas A&M University. ""We haven't ever had that many faithless electors in one election."" 
 
 Democratic elector Polly Baca (no relation to Micheal) said the Electoral College should be returned to its original conception — as laid out by Alexander Hamilton in the Federalist Papers — as a deliberative body able to exercise free choice while using popular votes only as a guide. 
 
 ""If we cannot use the Electoral College as a deliberative process ... then we ought to do away with it,"" said Baca, a former co-chairman of the Democratic National Convention and former Colorado state senator. 
 
 The 538 members who comprise the Electoral College are slated to gather in their respective state capitals on Dec. 19 to cast the formal vote for president. Trump won the popular vote in states making up 290 electoral votes — and he’s leading narrowly in Michigan, which carries another 16 electoral votes. If all of them vote for Trump, he’ll win 306 electoral votes, easily exceeding the 270-vote majority he needs to become president. That's why the magic number is 37 Republican defections. 
 
 Dozens of Republican electors, picked at state and local party conventions, have signaled discomfort with Trump, but most have committed to supporting him despite their misgivings. Only a handful have said they'd consider voting against him in the Electoral College. 
 
 One, Texas' Art Sisneros, said he's still making up his mind. South Dakota Gov. Dennis Daugaard, another elector, called on Trump to withdraw from the race after a tape of his comments about sexually assaulting women leaked in October. But he's since confirmed he'd still support Trump with his electoral vote. 
 
 A slew of Democrats, on the other hand, have also signaled they may defect from Clinton, which wouldn't help or hinder Trump's path to the White House but could contribute to a sense of disarray and voter disenfranchisement. 
 
 In any case, it's hard to know exactly how many faithless electors may be out there because there's no organized effort by candidates or parties to whip votes or track support. 
 
 Polly Baca, who's still considering whether to cast her vote against Clinton, said that she'll decide in part based on whether there's a strategic consensus reached with other Democrats to vote for another candidate. 
 
 Already, the six Democrats prepared to be ""faithless"" electors would be the most to defect from their party's presidential candidate since 1872 , when Democratic nominee Horace Greeley died before electors cast their votes. The last time that many electors rejected a living presidential candidate was 1808 . 
 
 Robert Nemanich, another Colorado elector prepared to cast a faithless vote, said he's spoken to five electors in his state alone who intend to join him. 
 
 The rarity of the faithless elector phenomenon is rooted in electors’ reluctance to reject the will of the voters. But it’s also because 29 states — including Colorado and Washington — have laws mandating that electors support the winner of the state popular vote. 
 
 These laws, though, have never been enforced or challenged. And some of them impose only modest fines but provide no recourse to change the outcome. 
 
 In recent elections, the Electoral College has become an increasingly vexing issue for Democrats, who won the popular vote in 2000, only to see George W. Bush take the White House because of the electoral vote math. Should the college vote for Trump, as expected, it'll be the same story: Clinton led the popular vote by about 1.7 million votes as of Monday morning. 
 
 To repeal the Electoral College outright would require a constitutional amendment — and Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) conveniently proposed one last week. But it's unlikely to advance in a Republican-controlled Congress. Another measure, a multistate compact already enacted in 11 states, would require electors to support the winner of the national popular vote. But that would take effect only if enough states join to comprise a majority of the Electoral College. 
 
 So far, the 11 signatory states — all solidly Democratic — make up just 165 electoral votes. 
 
 Ironically, Democrats have taken heart from Trump’s own statements regarding the Electoral College. In the past, the president-elect has called the body a "" disaster for democracy ."" In 2012, he urged supporters to march on Washington when he believed Mitt Romney had won the popular vote but lost the Electoral College. 
 
 His views haven’t changed. In a recent, post-election interview with ""60 Minutes,"" he said, ""I would rather see it where you went with simple votes."" ||||| BOISE, Idaho (AP) — Grassroots campaigns have sprung up around the country to try to persuade members of the Electoral College to do something that has never been done in American history — deny the presidency to the clear Election Day winner. 
 
 Activists are circulating online petitions and using social media in hopes of influencing Republican electors to cast their ballots for someone other than President-elect Donald Trump and deprive him of the 270 Electoral College votes needed to become the next occupant of the White House. 
 
 ""Yes, I think it's a longshot, but I also think we're living in strange times,"" said Daniel Brezenoff, who created a petition in favor of Hillary Clinton and is asking signers to lobby electors by email or phone. ""If it was ever plausible, it's this year."" 
 
 Trump has won 290 electoral votes to Clinton's 232, with Michigan undecided, but Clinton is on pace to win the popular vote by at least 1 million ballots. Trump's opponents are motivated by the outcome of the popular vote and by their contention that the businessman and reality TV star is unfit to serve as commander in chief. 
 
 Just one elector so far has wavered publicly on supporting Trump. 
 
 Texas Republican Art Sisneros says he has reservations about the president-elect, but not because of the national popular vote. He told The Associated Press he won't vote for Clinton under any circumstance. 
 
 ""As a Christian, I came to the conclusion that Mr. Trump is not biblically qualified for that office,"" he said. 
 
 He said he has heard from ecstatic Clinton supporters and even supportive Republicans, but also from outraged Trump backers writing ""threatening and vile things."" 
 
 Sisneros signed a state party pledge to support the GOP's standard-bearer, but that was before Trump was the official nominee. He said one of his options is to resign, allowing the state party to choose another elector. 
 
 Electors are chosen by party officials and are typically the party's most loyal members. Presidential electors are not required to vote for a particular candidate under the Constitution. Even so, the National Archives says more than 99 percent of electors have voted as pledged throughout the nation's history. 
 
 Some state laws call for fines against ""faithless electors,"" while others open them to possible felony charges, although the National Archives says no elector has ever been prosecuted for failing to vote as pledged. In North Carolina, a faithless elector's vote is canceled, and he or she must immediately resign and be replaced. 
 
 Layne Bangerter and Melinda Smyser, two of Idaho's four Republican electors, said they have been flooded with emails, telephone calls and Facebook messages from strangers urging them to reconsider their vote. 
 
 ""It's just not going to work,"" Bangerter said. ""I hope it dies down, but I don't see that happening."" 
 
 The volume and tone of the messages caught the attention of Idaho's secretary of state, who urged the public to remain civil as electors prepare to cast their ballots on Dec. 19 while meeting in their states. 
 
 Republican Party officials in Georgia and Michigan said their electors also have been bombarded with messages, and Iowa reported increased public interest in obtaining contact information for electors. 
 
 Michael Banerian, 22, one of Michigan's 16 Republican electors, said he has received death threats from people who do not want him to vote for Trump. But he said he is undeterred. 
 
 ""It's mostly just a lot of angry people who don't completely understand how the process works,"" said Banerian, a political science major at Oakland University. 
 
 P. Bret Chiafalo, a Democratic elector in Washington state, said he and a small group of other electors from the party are working to contact their Republican counterparts and ask them to vote for any GOP candidate besides Trump, preferably Mitt Romney or John Kasich. 
 
 Under the Constitution, the House — currently under Republican control — decides the presidency if no candidate reaches the required electoral vote majority. House members choose from the top three contenders. 
 
 This isn't the first time electors have faced pressure to undo the results of Election Day. 
 
 Carole Jean Jordan, a GOP elector from Florida in 2000, recalled the ""unbelievably ugly"" aftermath of the recount battle between George W. Bush and then-vice president Al Gore, a dispute that ended with the U.S. Supreme Court leaving Bush's slim margin intact and handing him the presidency. 
 
 Jordan said Florida's electors were inundated with nasty letters from people saying they should not vote for Bush. Police kept watch over her home until the electors convened in Tallahassee to cast their votes. They stayed at the same hotel, guarded by security officers who also escorted them to cast their ballots at the state Capitol.

 Corrections & Clarifications: An earlier version of this report had fewer states with laws governing electors. 
 
 To supporters of Hillary Clinton, the number looks intoxicating: 155 electors in states where the popular vote went for Donald Trump — some by slim margins — who apparently aren't legally bound to vote for the GOP presidential nominee when the Electoral College meets Dec. 19. 
 
 Solicit them like lobbyists schmooze members of Congress, right? Persuade just a portion, and you've got the first woman president, winner of the popular vote, certified by a constitutional authority. 
 
 
 
 She's got 232 in the bag. She would need 38 ""faithless electors"" to win this game. 
 
 That's the problem with this particular political fantasy. Though electors in several states report that they're getting thousands of emails, letters and even telephone calls to ask them to switch their votes, they're among the Republican Party's most loyal members. 
 
 ""I fully intend to vote for Donald Trump,"" said Jim Skaggs of Bowling Green, Ky., one of that state's eight electors, who added that he really doesn't like Trump. ""It's not a law, I don't think. ... But I think it’s a duty."" 
 
 “I fully intend to vote for Donald Trump. It's not a law, I don't think. ... But I think it’s a duty.” Jim Skaggs, Bowling Green, Ky. 
 
 He's right. Kentucky is one of 22 states, according to the Congressional Research Service and additional USA TODAY research, that don't mandate their electors to vote for the winner of their state's popular vote. The Constitution and federal law are silent on the matter. 
 
 More than 4.5 million supporters have signed a Change.org petition advocating electors' change of heart, but the desire is little more than a pipe dream, election experts said. Two Democratic electors in Colorado and Washington state, where Clinton won the electoral votes and electors are obligated under state law to vote for her, have launched their own movement that they've dubbed ""Moral Electors"" to achieve the same result — or more likely throw the decision to the House of Representatives as happened in 1824. 
 
 “This is a long shot. It’s a Hail Mary,” P. Bret Chiafalo of Everett, Wash., told Politico. “However, I do see situations where — when we’ve already had two or three (Republican) electors state publicly they didn’t want to vote for Trump. How many of them have real issues with Donald Trump in private?” 
 
 Where Chiafalo sees a Hail Mary play, some Trump electors consider the drama more as harassment. 
 
 ""Hillary's got a great campaign going,"" said Sharon Geise, an elector from Mesa, Ariz., who estimates 8,000 emails have flooded her inbox. ""It's the same thing, pretty much. Basically: Vote for Hillary Clinton. It's bizarre. I don't dare answer my phone."" 
 
 A dozen letters urging her to back anybody but Trump arrived at her home Thursday. 
 
 ""She has to stop all of this,"" Geise said of Clinton. ""This is ridiculous."" 
 
 It's not clear whether Clinton supports this movement. She conceded to Trump on the day after the election, and President Obama, a Democrat who endorsed his former secretary of State, committed to a smooth transition of power. 
 
 Even delegations from states such as Florida that can inflict penalties for voting by conscience instead of popular vote haven't escaped activists' barrage. 
 
 In Florida, a faithless elector would be charged with a misdemeanor, prohibited from casting an Electoral College vote and replaced, presumably with an alternate more faithful to the popular-vote results in the state, said Franita Tolson, a voting rights law professor at Florida State University. That elector's political future within the GOP would be toast. 
 
 Historically, fewer than two electors per presidential election have changed their votes because they didn't want the candidate on whose slate they ran, according to FairVote.org, a District of Columbia-based non-partisan, non-profit group. The most recent was in 2004 and might have been a mistake. 
 
 ""It sounds like sour grapes to me,"" the incoming president of Florida's Senate and an elector, Joe Negron of Stuart, said about the movement to change electors' stripes. ""We had an election in Florida, and Donald Trump received the majority of votes and therefore gets 29 electoral votes."" 
 
 Elector Susan Moore of Pensacola, Fla., has been a Republican Party loyalist since she started volunteering in Tennessee when she was 12. She has more than 800 emails, many of them part of the same form letter, in her inbox. 
 
 ""When it comes down to it, I think these people mean well,"" she said of the anti-Trump sector. ""But they’re asking us to do something that’s really not going to work out the way they want.""

 Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2ggtaJx","– A Change.org petition lobbying the Electoral College's electors to make Hillary Clinton president based on her winning the popular vote is indeed a long shot—but the petition has more than 4.5 million signatures, and a plan is now being floated by a handful of electors to upend Donald Trump's anticipated Electoral College win. At least six Democratic electors—whom Politico pegs as being ""mostly former Bernie Sanders supporters who hail from Washington state and Colorado""—are trying to convince GOP electors not to vote for Trump when the ballots are cast on Dec. 19. It would be a near-impossible climb to pull off such a coup: They'd need at least 37 GOPers to reject him. And even if these so-called ""faithless electors"" succeed, the vote goes to the House, now run by the GOP. But even if it's unlikely they pull it off, the rogues are hoping to achieve something else: take away confidence in the Electoral College and perhaps eventually dismantle it. That means they may even appeal to Democratic electors to throw away Clinton votes and team up with GOPers to award votes to someone like Mitt Romney or John Kasich. ""We're trying to be that 'break in case of emergency' fire hose that's gotten dusty over the last 200 years,"" Washington's Bret Chaifalo tells the Atlantic. ""This is an emergency.""

""If it was ever plausible, it's this year.""","['On December 19, the Electors of the Electoral College will cast their ballots. If they all vote the way their states voted, Donald Trump will win. However, in 14 of the states in Trump\'s column, they can vote for Hillary Clinton without any legal penalty if they choose. \n \n We are calling on the 149 Electors in those states to ignore their states\' votes and cast their ballots for Secretary Clinton. Why? \n \n Mr. Trump is unfit to serve. His scapegoating of so many Americans, and his impulsivity, bullying, lying, admitted history of sexual assault, and utter lack of experience make him a danger to the Republic. \n \n Secretary Clinton WON THE POPULAR VOTE and should be President. \n \n Hillary won the popular vote. The only reason Trump ""won"" is because of the Electoral College. \n \n But the Electoral College can actually give the White House to either candidate. So why not use this most undemocratic of our institutions to ensure a democratic result? \n \n SHE WON THE POPULAR VOTE. \n \n There is no reason Trump should be President. \n \n ""It\'s the \'People\'s Will\'"" \n \n No. She won the popular vote. \n \n ""Our system of government under our Constitution says he wins"" \n \n No. Our Constitution says the Electors choose. \n \n ""Too many states prohibit \'Faithless Electors\'"" \n \n 24 states bind electors.

', ' The college’s members come from all 50 states and Washington, D.C.; the number of electors a state has corresponds with the number of House and Senate members who represent it in Congress. Baca and Chiafalo are not pushing for Republican electors to all switch their allegiance to Clinton, who’s winning the popular vote nationwide even as her Electoral College count lags behind Trump’s. Instead, they suggest a “compromise candidate”—a Republican they find less objectionable than Trump, such as former Republican nominee Mitt Romney or Ohio Governor John Kasich. (Though those options are just placeholders; they said it should be up to the Republican electors to pick a new standard-bearer.) \n \n Baca described their best-case scenario: uniting 135 Republican and 135 Democratic electors behind a moderate Republican candidate, thus securing that person’s position as president with the required 270 votes. If that doesn’t work, and it’s highly unlikely it will, they’re hoping they can at least convince 37 of the Republican electors whose states went for Trump to default and support the compromise candidate. That would bring Trump’s count below 270, and the election would then go to the House of Representatives. While there’s a strong chance that, in that hypothetical scenario, the Republican-controlled House would nevertheless vote to install Trump, Baca and Chiafolo would hope that, given the opportunity, they would support a more conventional Republican instead. \n \n This would be in the legislature’s best interest, Baca said, because a different Republican candidate who “actually knows what they’re doing” would be able to more smoothly enact a Republican Congress’s agenda. Though Baca and Chiafolo’s states voted for Clinton, they said they would both gladly support a moderate compromise candidate from the GOP; Chiafolo, a Bernie Sanders supporter during the Democratic primary, previously told a Seattle Times reporter that he hadn’t “ruled out” withholding his vote from Clinton. \n \n So far, seven Democratic electors, including Baca and Chiafolo, are willing to support a Republican candidate other than Trump. No Republican electors have come on board yet. But “we hope that once the first Republican peels away, once we have one who is brave enough to stick to their morals,” Baca said, “then we’ll see a wave of support.” \n \n They’re not currently contacting the Republican electors directly and discourage their supporters from doing so. Instead, they’re focusing on getting the word out through a social-media campaign and through their website. “The general strategy right now is to educate and support the Republican electors, to let them know that they have the right—the duty—to pick who they think is right for the presidency,” Chiafalo said. \n \n College of Charleston political science professor Claire Wofford explained to me that the founding fathers were actually quite afraid of direct democracy; they put the Electoral College in place as a fail-safe to protect the American presidency from a candidate who’s popular but unfit for office. “Several features of our government are designed to ‘filter’ what the [constitutional] framers saw might be the irrationality and emotion of the populace, including the Electoral College,” she said. “So you could argue that the election of Trump is just such an instance, in which a demagogue has somehow managed to ‘sway’ an easily misled public.” Wofford said “there is no explicit federal or constitutional ban on electors selecting candidates as they wish, even if that means departing from the popular vote of the state.” ', ' At least a half-dozen Democratic electors have signed onto an attempt to block Donald Trump from winning an Electoral College majority, an effort designed not only to deny Trump the presidency but also to undermine the legitimacy of the institution. \n \n The presidential electors, mostly former Bernie Sanders supporters who hail from Washington state and Colorado, are now lobbying their Republican counterparts in other states to reject their oaths — and in some cases, state law — to vote against Trump when the Electoral College meets on Dec. 19. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n Even the most optimistic among the Democratic electors acknowledges they\'re unlikely to persuade the necessary 37 Republican electors to reject Trump — the number they\'d likely need to deny him the presidency and send the final decision to the House of Representatives.

""I hope it dies down, but I don\'t see that happening."" \n \n The volume and tone of the messages caught the attention of Idaho\'s secretary of state, who urged the public to remain civil as electors prepare to cast their ballots on Dec. 19 while meeting in their states. \n \n Republican Party officials in Georgia and Michigan said their electors also have been bombarded with messages, and Iowa reported increased public interest in obtaining contact information for electors. \n \n Michael Banerian, 22, one of Michigan\'s 16 Republican electors, said he has received death threats from people who do not want him to vote for Trump. But he said he is undeterred. \n \n ""It\'s mostly just a lot of angry people who don\'t completely understand how the process works,"" said Banerian, a political science major at Oakland University. \n \n P. Bret Chiafalo, a Democratic elector in Washington state, said he and a small group of other electors from the party are working to contact their Republican counterparts and ask them to vote for any GOP candidate besides Trump, preferably Mitt Romney or John Kasich. \n \n Under the Constitution, the House — currently under Republican control — decides the presidency if no candidate reaches the required electoral vote majority. House members choose from the top three contenders. \n \n This isn\'t the first time electors have faced pressure to undo the results of Election Day. \n \n Carole Jean Jordan, a GOP elector from Florida in 2000, recalled the ""unbelievably ugly"" aftermath of the recount battle between George W. Bush and then-vice president Al Gore, a dispute that ended with the U.S. Supreme Court leaving Bush\'s slim margin intact and handing him the presidency. \n \n Jordan said Florida\'s electors were inundated with nasty letters from people saying they should not vote for Bush. Police kept watch over her home until the electors convened in Tallahassee to cast their votes. They stayed at the same hotel, guarded by security officers who also escorted them to cast their ballots at the state Capitol. \n \n ___ \n \n Barrow reported from Atlanta. \n \n ___ \n \n Follow Kimberlee Kruesi at https://twitter.com/kkruesi and Bill Barrow at https://twitter.com/BillBarrowAP ', ' CLOSE They\'re called electors. But who the hell are they? Video provided by Newsy Newslook \n \n Even without counting Michigan, whose 16 electoral votes probably will be awarded to Donald Trump, the GOP nominee has more than a majority of Electoral College votes. (Photo: USA TODAY) \n \n Corrections & Clarifications: An earlier version of this report had fewer states with laws governing electors. \n \n To supporters of Hillary Clinton, the number looks intoxicating: 155 electors in states where the popular vote went for Donald Trump — some by slim margins — who apparently aren\'t legally bound to vote for the GOP presidential nominee when the Electoral College meets Dec. 19. \n \n Solicit them like lobbyists schmooze members of Congress, right? Persuade just a portion, and you\'ve got the first woman president, winner of the popular vote, certified by a constitutional authority. \n \n \n \n She\'s got 232 in the bag. She would need 38 ""faithless electors"" to win this game. \n \n That\'s the problem with this particular political fantasy. Though electors in several states report that they\'re getting thousands of emails, letters and even telephone calls to ask them to switch their votes, they\'re among the Republican Party\'s most loyal members. \n \n ""I fully intend to vote for Donald Trump,"" said Jim Skaggs of Bowling Green, Ky., one of that state\'s eight electors, who added that he really doesn\'t like Trump. ""It\'s not a law, I don\'t think. ... But I think it’s a duty."" \n \n “I fully intend to vote for Donald Trump. It\'s not a law, I don\'t think. ... But I think it’s a duty.” Jim Skaggs, Bowling Green, Ky. \n \n He\'s right. Kentucky is one of 22 states, according to the Congressional Research Service and additional USA TODAY research, that don\'t mandate their electors to vote for the winner of their state\'s popular vote. The Constitution and federal law are silent on the matter. \n \n More than 4.5 million supporters have signed a Change.org petition advocating electors\' change of heart, but the desire is little more than a pipe dream, election experts said. Two Democratic electors in Colorado and Washington state, where Clinton won the electoral votes and electors are obligated under state law to vote for her, have launched their own movement that they\'ve dubbed ""Moral Electors"" to achieve the same result — or more likely throw the decision to the House of Representatives as happened in 1824. \n \n “This is a long shot. It’s a Hail Mary,” P. Bret Chiafalo of Everett, Wash., told Politico. “However, I do see situations where — when we’ve already had two or three (Republican) electors state publicly they didn’t want to vote for Trump. How many of them have real issues with Donald Trump in private?” \n \n Where Chiafalo sees a Hail Mary play, some Trump electors consider the drama more as harassment. \n \n ""Hillary\'s got a great campaign going,"" said Sharon Geise, an elector from Mesa, Ariz., who estimates 8,000 emails have flooded her inbox. ""It\'s the same thing, pretty much. Basically: Vote for Hillary Clinton. It\'s bizarre. I don\'t dare answer my phone."" \n \n A dozen letters urging her to back anybody but Trump arrived at her home Thursday. \n \n ""She has to stop all of this,"" Geise said of Clinton. ""This is ridiculous."" \n \n It\'s not clear whether Clinton supports this movement. She conceded to Trump on the day after the election, and President Obama, a Democrat who endorsed his former secretary of State, committed to a smooth transition of power. \n \n Even delegations from states such as Florida that can inflict penalties for voting by conscience instead of popular vote haven\'t escaped activists\' barrage. \n \n In Florida, a faithless elector would be charged with a misdemeanor, prohibited from casting an Electoral College vote and replaced, presumably with an alternate more faithful to the popular-vote results in the state, said Franita Tolson, a voting rights law professor at Florida State University. That elector\'s political future within the GOP would be toast. \n \n Historically, fewer than two electors per presidential election have changed their votes because they didn\'t want the candidate on whose slate they ran, according to FairVote.org, a District of Columbia-based non-partisan, non-profit group. The most recent was in 2004 and might have been a mistake. \n \n ""It sounds like sour grapes to me,"" the incoming president of Florida\'s Senate and an elector, Joe Negron of Stuart, said about the movement to change electors\' stripes. ""We had an election in Florida, and Donald Trump received the majority of votes and therefore gets 29 electoral votes."" \n \n Elector Susan Moore of Pensacola, Fla., has been a Republican Party loyalist since she started volunteering in Tennessee when she was 12. She has more than 800 emails, many of them part of the same form letter, in her inbox. \n \n ""When it comes down to it, I think these people mean well,"" she said of the anti-Trump sector. ""But they’re asking us to do something that’s really not going to work out the way they want."" \n \n Contributing: Isadora Rangel, The (Stuart, Fla.) News.
